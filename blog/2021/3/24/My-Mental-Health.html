Their effects have had deep repurcussions on my life growing up. But that's something I won't really go into. For this article, I'll be focusing on <em>my</em> mental health and the impact it has had on my life as an adult.</p> <p>To preface, I think the first recognizance of my mentla health came as a child when I was diagnosed with mild ADHD. I never really noticed the effects Adderall had on behavior or thoughts so I never took this diagnosis very seriously and was ultimately taken off the medication. I think the diagnosis was mostly related to the fact that I admitted to often having difficulty sleeping, a problem which would persist into my adult life with little impact on my responsibilities.</p> <p>By the time I graduated high school, I was independant, self-sufficient and most importantly, happy. My mental health was not on my radar at all. I knew I was relatively smart and capable and I prided myself on my ability to think critically and plan for the future. My confidence came from my recent <a href="/pdf/ACT-scores.pdf">ACT</a> and <a href="/pdf/SAT-scores.pdf">SAT</a> scores as well as the fact that I had achieved my goal of earning the rank of <a href="/blog/2011/5/Eagle-Scout.html">Eagle Scout</a> before my 18th birthday.</p> <p>Life was good.</p> <h2 id="episode-1"><a href="#episode-1" class="header-anchor">#</a> Episode 1</h2> <div class="resp-container"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTXT6QZ9Ric" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="resp-iframe"></iframe></div> <p>My first psychotic episode came unexpectedly. I was a sophomore at my university and it seemed like my life couldn't get any better. I was living off campus at an apartment that I was paying for through my internship I had at <a href="/blog/2012/2/15/INTERNSHIP.html">DiSTI</a>.</p> <center><blockquote

couldn't get any better. I had a very cool roommate that I got along well with. He introduced me to weed, something that I had researched myself in high school and was determined to try now that I was an adult. While I had a good smoking, I would usually limit myself to doing so only on weekends.</p> <p>Eventually, I'd slowly stop smoking for the most part, since I felt I had &quot;expanded my mind&quot; already in doing so, and it wasn't something I wanted to become a habit. By now, I had unprecidented levels of self-confidence. I would peacock with brightly colored clothing and hit on girls often.</p> <p>There was one girl in particular who I fancied and I began to grow more bold with her. I was cocky. Funny. I felt invincible. On top of the world.</p> <p>Manic.</p> <p>I felt like a different person entirely. Like something had awakened in me. A concsiousness that was mine but had remained dormant for so long that I didn't recognize it as my own. As if a new spirit had inhabited my body.</p> <p>&quot;I am Jesus Christ.&quot; I said while high with my brother one day. It was like an epiphany I had. My brother didn't like that. He was concerned but I convinced him I didn't really think that. And I didn't, excpet maybe figuratively. My parents being religious named my sister and I Christina and Christofer after Christ, as thanks for answering their prayers for twins. Growing up with a very religious upbringing, I thought perhaps <em>I</em> was the reincarnation of Christ. After all, we had been preached to for so long that we were in the &quot;latter days&quot; and that the second-coming was nigh upon us.</p> <p>This marked the beginning of my spiral into madness. Things in my life were going <em>too</em> well it seemed. Like a wheel spinning too fast before flying off it's axis, I lost control of myself.</p> <p>One day, I decided to chill on the grass in front of the Reflection pond. It was a gorgeous day. As I lay there throughout the day, others around me had the same idea and would stop to sit on the grass and enjoy the sunshine.</p> <p>It was here that I had my first vision. I peered into the sun and I saw the future.</p> <p>Aliens.</p> <p>We were woefully unprepared. There was an invasion approaching and I was the only one who knew about it. We had little time left and a lot of work to do. I needed to hustle. This, was Day 1.</p> <p>I knew I needed to reach a higher authority to warn someone about this. It was possible I was the new prophet. Throughout my life, I had always been blessed with the gift of vision.</p> <p>I tried to called my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(Latter_Day_Saints)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bishop<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> and requested to speak to his superior. I had hoped to do so all the way up the chain of command until I could speak to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet,_seer,_and_revelator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prophet<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> himself.</p> <p>Of course, none of them believed me and I didn't make it very far. I was chided for not respecting the chain of command. Regardless, I met with my bishop still and confessed all my sins.</p> <p>I was now guilt free, able to act with a clear conscious.</p> <p>A few days later, I decided to walk to campus from my apartment. As I walked, I started to discard the contents of my wallet; wedging my ID cards between the edge of the sidewalk and the grass, hiding a card on top of a utility box jutting out from the side of a building. I think it symbolized to me the fact that I didn't need any kind of government ID to know who I was.</p> <p>Somehow, this was how I started to see the world, as symbols with deeper meanings. Every action I took, a parable; Every word spoken layered with double meanings. I was delusional and didn't realize it.</p> <p>I didn't go to class that day. Instead, I continued to walk around campus, chasing &quot;clues&quot; and following an unseen path I had discovered towards some unknown secret the symbols were revealing to me. Arbitrary numbers for times and locations were now codes hidden in plain sight, speaking to me.</p> <p><em>I was being watched</em>, they said. <em>Followed.</em></p> <p>And why shouldn't I be? I was exceptional. An <a href="/blog/2011/5/Eagle-Scout.html">Eagle Scout</a> without a mission. I was under the delusion that the government was recruiting me to be a top secret agent through a program that was hidden in plain sight, available to anyone with the aptitude to see the pattern. I believed that if I followed this path long enough, I would be &quot;flagged by the system&quot; and contacted for recruitment. In fact, I thought I was <em>already</em> being contacted.</p> <p>Subtitles on live TV were instructions programed for me at the precise moment that I glanced at them. Electronic cross walk signs were somehow a test of my patience. Even simple advertisements were products placed along my path to tempt or guide me.</p> <p>I had to shake my tail. I didn't want to be followed.</p> <p>I ditched my backpack. I dipped into a Barnes and Noble on campus. Grabbing a blue tanktop off the rack, I swapped it with my shirt and walked out of the store with my new disguise.</p> <p>Surrounding me everywhere were people with eadbuds. Every one of them, a potential agent receiving instructions from the unkown entity watching me.</p> <p>I started to become enraged. Was everyone in on this charade? How could they all give into the system? How could I be the only one breaking from the script?</p> <p>I entered the library; I knew where to find answers.</p> <p>Stepping into the elevator, I punched in the button for the top floor. The highest floor in one of the oldest buildings on campus. Surely this was where the headquarters would be hiding.</p> <p>The doors opened. To my dismay, before me lay the familiar layout of the top floor of the library. Unchanged.</p> <p>I shouldn't have been dissappointed, and yet I was.</p> <p>I left the building and took off my shirt, no longer caring about my disguise. I lay on the grass in front of the Reflection pond just outside the library.</p> <p>Two cops approached me. I don't remember what they said, but I went with them anyway. I was ready to be taken in. If this whole system was a lie, I had nothing left for me here. I was ready to embrace my destiny and be accepted into the program as a secret agent.</p> <div class="info"><b>To be continued.</b></div> <div>
