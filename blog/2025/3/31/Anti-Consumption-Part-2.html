The day before, I bought all my groceries ahead of time and then the day of, I cooked all my meals, cancelled my subscriptions, and then hung out and played Magic with my friends. The joy and beauty of this action was that I didn't have to disrupt my life to stick the middle finger to the oligarchs. I could simply be more conscious of the choices I made and how I spent my money.</p> <h2 id="anti-consumption-lifestyle-changes"><a href="#anti-consumption-lifestyle-changes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Anti-Consumption Lifestyle Changes</h2> <p>I have to say, I was pretty excited by this whole notion. It <em>feels good</em> to spend money, knowing it's going to a good cause and not just having it slip through your fingers to the monopoly on convenience.</p> <p>Since February 28th, I haven't purchased anything from Amazon and honestly, it hasn't been as big of an inconvenience as I thought. First of all, since I cancelled my Amazon Prime subscription, I think I've been buying less things online. I still bought the usually things I <em>would</em> have purchased, I just bought them directly from retailers. For example, I bought my favorite hot sauce on sale from <a href="https://heathotsauce.com/products/torchbearer-garlic-reaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heathotsauce.com<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>; I purchased more of my classic white t-shirts from <a href="https://strongsize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strongsize.com<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <p>Let's be real, the 2-day delivery guarantee— the convenience that you are paying for, is the only thing that is lost from ditching Amazon. After I wrote my last article, my sister in-law let me know that her and my brother have not been using Amazon for almost 2 years now.</p> <p>Part of the reason for doing this is to direct your money to supporting local businesses instead. I spent a lot of time thinking about this and how, what I like to call, being a &quot;responsible consumer&quot; has changed my life. I'm going to go over the three main areas that I considered being a responsible consumer in: social media, grocery stores, and technology that I use.</p> <h3 id="social-media"><a href="#social-media" class="header-anchor">#</a> Social Media</h3> <h4 id="bluesky"><a href="#bluesky" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bluesky</h4> <p><img src="/images/bluesky.png" alt="Bluesky"></p> <p>I liked Twitter. I guess you could say I enjoy micro-blogging and reading other peoples micro-blog posts.</p> <p>X is... not really Twitter anymore. There has been a growing sentiment of people who feel that the platform has been overrun by bots, but not only that, but by far right extremists as well. While I'm generally against forms of censorship, the following comic (I found floating around on Blusky when I first joined) explains pretty well the dynamic that occurs with platforms without enforcement of community guidelines.</p> <p><img src="/images/x-twitter.jpg" alt="X comic"></p> <p>Either way, I switched over to Bluesky because of the vibes and to stop directly supporting Elon Musk. What I've found on Bluesky is that it feels very much like early Twitter (at least what I remember from my rose-tinted glasses). Is it left-leaning? Yes, absolutely. I think many people motivated to leave X for a new platform are going to be left-leaning, and honestly: I prefer it to a right-leaning platform.</p> <p>Politics, aside, the <em>real</em> reason why I switched to Bluesky is because the technology is so much better! Let me tell you about all the cool features of Bluesky.</p> <h5 id="at-protocol"><a href="#at-protocol" class="header-anchor">#</a> AT Protocol</h5> <p>Bluesky is built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT Protocol<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>. The AT Protocol is a protocol and open standard for distributed social networking services. The protocol was created as an independent research group within Twitter to investigate the possibility of decentralizing the service. Note, this does not mean it's built on the blockchain! The really cool thing about this is the moderation is decentralized, allowing different levels of moderation by communities.</p> <p>The details on this are very interesting and it actually solves the problem outlined in the comic above! Basically, the protocol allows for different parties (platforms, third-party moderators, or users) to apply labels to content, accounts, or posts. Users and services can then choose which labels to follow, tailoring their content experience.</p> <p>As far as design is concerned, rather than having a monolithic database hosting the user data and application, the AT Protocol splits up these elements into smaller microservices which can be used as needed.

Then, you can also display a graph showing all the interconnectedness of your notes, assuming you properly tag and link your other articles.</p> <p>That's a nice feature, but this app fits perfectly for my needs because I already keep my notes in markdown format on my desktop. So I subscribed to <a href="https://obsidian.md/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian Sync<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> to sync my notes to the phone app. The neat thing about this is since you're just dealing with markdown files, you don't need to pay to sync your notes; you can set up your own method for synchronizing these files. For example, I just set up my <a href="/blog/2021/1/9/TubeTV.html">Rasberry Pi</a> again and I could set up a service to sync the files.</p> <p>But I just bought Obsidian Sync because it was easier.

And I did! Installation was a breeze and I suddenly had a bunch of extra security features.</p> <p>I found this video which explained how to set up your account with multiple users. Ideally, you leave the Owner (default user) as the &quot;root&quot; user for installing apps, and then you have your secondary user you install the apps to. It's very secure and sandboxed, even if you don't jump through all the hoops he does to install apps outside of the Play store.</p> <div class="resp-container"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IAoCfrqxIEg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="resp-iframe"></iframe></div> <p>It worked great, honestly. The one thing that I had troubles with were MMS messages. I think it had something to do with setting up Google Fi on my phone, but my secondary profile was not able to send or receive MMS messages. Time after time of searching for a solution to this, I was reminded that SMS/MMS messages are insecure and you should use a more secure alternative like the <a href="https://signal.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signal<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> app (which I use).</p> <p>Ultimately, I failed to convince my friends to download Signal for our group chat and I needed to text my landlord a picture, so I switched back to stock Android. I couldn't figure out my issue, much as I tried.</p> <p>But otherwise, I would highly recommend GraphenOS as an alternative.</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conclusion</h2> <p>If you've read this far, thank you. I really do put a lot of effort into my posts. This one was mostly about my experiences with being a responsible consumer, but I hope it offers some insight into those looking to make similar changes in their own lifestyle.</p> <p>I have to say, by the end of the month, my grocery bill went from $325 to $536, but my dining out went from $1157 to $453 (shout out to <a href="https://www.ynab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YNAB<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>). I ate out a lot February, but I also cooked a lot more in March. I was inspired by my lifestyle changes to eat out less. This is just one data point, so I'll be sure to keep an eye on these numbers over the next few months.</p> <p>I also feel much happier, more satisfied, and more fulfilled in my daily life. I don't want to attribute all of this to the changes I've been making, but I'm sure it helps I've eliminated one potential source of cognitive dissonance.</p> <div>
