I thought the time alloted for the movie was managed very well.

Battle: LA was about the character drama, with a believable interactions between the characters whose genuine emotion I can only compare to The Walking Dead comics. Unlike showing the stress a zombie apocalypse places on a person, it focuses on how the alien invasion affected a small squad of marines. They're tasked with rescuing a small group of survivors bunkered down in a police station. The story becomes a lot more intriguing as complications arrive and they engage in small skirmishes with the aliens.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v('I found out later that the directer\'s aim behind the mvie was to make the most "realistic" alien invasion movie to date. And I have to admit, those were my exact words when describing the film I just saw to some one. The directer said he wanted the film to be shot the same way a YouTube video is captured, so you\'ll see a lot of hand-held camera action going on (especially at the beginning of the movie). Thats not the only thing that makes it seem realistic, though. The guns used in the movie seem so "real". Each bullet fired is accounted for, ammo is a real problem that has to be accounted for, and each encounter with the aliens seems pretty realistic, if not a little favorable for the small squad.')]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Before I even walked out of the theater, I knew that this was hands-down the best alien movie, I'd ever seen (replacing District 9 as my top favorite).
