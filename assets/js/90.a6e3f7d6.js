At the time, German miinimal techno music was booming and Anthony Favier would spend his nights listening to Stephan Bodzin, James Holden, or the very beginnings of Paul Kalkbrenner.\nThe story behind NTO is also about his friendship with Worakls and Joachim Paster, with whom he created Hungry Music in 2013. Performing together on the Olympia\'s stage to the Vieilles Charrues Festival, they learned to master the stage. Thanks to his hits "Trauma" and "La cl√© des champs", which account for several millions of streams on DSPs, NTO\'s career took off internationally.')])]),e._v(" "),t("TagLinks"),e._v(" "),t("Comments")],1)}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
