The exact date is unknown, so the day is for chronological order. \n \n Before I went to see Battle: LA, I was told by my friend's dad how horrible this movie was. \"I could've waited till it came out on DVD. It totally wasn't what the trailers showed it to be.\" And he was right about one thing: It wasn't exactly what the trailers had made it seem to be. If you've seen the trailer, you're probably jumping up and down excited to see a whole bunch of epic action sequences with aliens and explosions. Don't worry. You'll get that, and more. \n I think the point that the trailer misleads people at (as is usually the case with such movies) is that it makes it out to be this epic action movie. In reality, it delivered a lot more content than a plain old alien-shoot-em-up movie could by focusing on a smaller scale of the alien invasion of Los Angeles. I thought the time alloted for the movie was managed very well. There definitely seemed to be a lot of scenes that had to happen in the movie, yet it consistently maintained a good pace and flow so it felt natural and added to its believability. I think the movie covered roughly a 24 hour time period. \n For those of you who enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, the story line for Battle: LA was very similar to that, since it followed a key character, who was not by all means perfect, but had a mission to accomplish and wasn't the sort to let anything deter him from it. Battle: LA was about the character drama, with a believable interactions between the characters whose genuine emotion I can only compare to The Walking Dead comics. Unlike showing the stress a zombie apocalypse places on a person, it focuses on how the alien invasion affected a small squad of marines. They're tasked with rescuing a small group of survivors bunkered down in a police station. The story becomes a lot more intriguing as complications arrive and they engage in small skirmishes with the aliens. \n I found out later that the directer's aim behind the mvie was to make the most \"realistic\" alien invasion movie to date. And I have to admit, those were my exact words when describing the film I just saw to some one. The directer said he wanted the film to be shot the same way a YouTube video is captured, so you'll see a lot of hand-held camera action going on (especially at the beginning of the movie). Thats not the only thing that makes it seem realistic, though. The guns used in the movie seem so \"real\". Each bullet fired is accounted for, ammo is a real problem that has to be accounted for, and each encounter with the aliens seems pretty realistic, if not a little favorable for the small squad. \n Before I even walked out of the theater, I knew that this was hands-down the best alien movie, I'd ever seen (replacing District 9 as my top favorite). I think the only way that people wouldn't like this movie is the same way they didn't like District 9; it just wasn't what they wanted from an alien movie. Its as though even though there is an alien invasion going on, you can tell it's not the focus of the story: the focus is on the people who live through that event. I had no regret paying to see this in theaters and the next day, I had the urge to see it again -- something that rarely ever happens to me. \n \n \n"},{title:"Greatest. Song.

Apparently the two bands are close and Cage The Elephant was helping promote this new band. I followed the link and found this amazing music video full of fantastic visuals, brilliant colors, and psychedelic music. \n Instantly, I fell in love with it. Normally I wouldn't go for the fast-paced style that is psychedelic rock, but Expanding Anyway offered something more melodic than that. It didn't fall into just another wall of sound like a lot of other songs have a tendency to do. It keeps it lively by mixing it up throughout the song, until the big finale at the end. That's actually my favorite part of the song, where he vocalizes his \"la-la\"s and everyone gets up and dances. Including me. \n This band is still pretty small, but eventually I'm sure it will get the recognition that it deserves. They're coming to Orlando on the 29th, so I'm pretty excited to see them play. I'd love to see them perform Expanding Anyway live. \n 1/21/2021 Update:  I  did  end up seeing them live on the 29th at BackBooth Orlando. It was my very first concert, and I got to meet Tiger and the band. I even caught his pick as it fell off stage! It was one of the best shows of my life and instilled in me a deep love of live music. \n To this day, they remain one of my all time favorite bands. I even made a  website  for them. \n Rest in peace, Tiger. \n \n \n \n"},{title:"I'm Sinking Like a Stone in The Sea",frontmatter:{title:"I'm Sinking Like a Stone in The Sea",description:"A nice little song I found.",date:"2011-03-08T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Case Study","Music","Memories"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"I'm Sinking Like a Stone in The Sea"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A nice little song I found."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/I'm-Sinking-Like-a-Stone-in-The-Sea.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"I'm Sinking Like a Stone in The Sea"},{property:"og:description",content:"A nice little song I found."},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/I'm-Sinking-Like-a-Stone-in-The-Sea.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2011-03-08T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Case Study"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Music"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"I'm Sinking Like a Stone in The Sea"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A nice little song I found."}]},regularPath:"/blog/2011/3/I'm-Sinking-Like-a-Stone-in-The-Sea.html",relativePath:"blog/2011/3/I'm-Sinking-Like-a-Stone-in-The-Sea.md",key:"v-aadc2af6",path:"/blog/2011/3/I'm-Sinking-Like-a-Stone-in-The-Sea.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  nakedlogic.blogspot.com .

The exact date is unknown, so the day is for chronological order. \n \n The show tonight at Backbooth was simply amazing. I think this was definitely one of the best nights of my life. I had originally planned on just going by myself, since I didn't think anyone else I knew would be interested in going. As it turned out, I was wrong, and my sister Christina, Adam, my brother, and my friend Mikey and Dougie came with me (although it was later discovered that Mikey had never listened to the band beforehand). \n When we got there, there was a small line with an equally small wait, with the only unusual incident being a joke from a homeless man, which turned out to be less of a joke and more of a plea for \"donations\". There was a small poster that advertised Morning Teleportation playing that night and when I paid for my ticket and asked if I could keep it, I was told it was fine as long as it was still there. \n The venue was really nice; there was the bar in the front, and then in the other room a nice venue with a bar seating and even a balcony. I opted to stand in between to be closer to the stage. We ended up waiting an hour before the first band played, Coyote Theory. In the mean time, I bought a Morning Teleportation shirt, which Paul sold to me personally. They were just chillin' with us before the show and I got to meet them and get them all to sign my shirt, which made my evening. I was also really surprised at how quite Tiger's voice was. I guessed he must have been saving it for the show. \n When Coyote Theory finally played, it turned out to be pretty good. The bassist in particular caught my attention because of his obvious talent. He switched off halfway to play the drums and then the guitar. The band was local, and it turned out that most of the people who came to the show showed up for them as the room was promptly reduced by half once they finished. \n After them, Nicos Gun played. Nicos Gun had been touring with Morning Teleportation for the lat three weeks, and they were really good. Me and Dougie were really close to the stage, so to be honest, it was so loud I don't think I accurately heard what they sounded like. Still, I felt like they were awesome, and apparently they were. The lead guitarist/singer was shredding on his guitar during an awesome solo, and at one point he dropped his pick. It landed right in front of me, and when I picked it up to give it to him, I saw that he had already procured another one and let me keep it. Pretty dang cool. Afterward, we met with him as he was walking around and he talked about what it was like touring, coming from Philadelphia. He was surprised at the layout of Orlando, but we explained that he was in the downtown area and that there was no residential area there. He said it was a lot like Chicago. \n Finally came the moment I had been waiting for; Morning Teleportation. They were awesome. Having already met with them, it was amazing to see them perform, knowing them as people and from listening to their studio sound. It was pretty cool to have them play a song that I recognized form listening to a thousand times. Most of the people in the audience were singing along to the lyrics and jamming to the music. When they finished we had to leave pretty quickly, since our parking ticket had expired half an hour ago and Mikey was afraid he'd get a ticket. On our way out, we got one last chat with the drummer of the band. I also grabbed the poster out front. \n Coming home, smelling like smoke and beer, pick in my pocket and poster in hand, I felt exhausted from the whole experience. For the first live show I'd ever been to, it was pretty damn good. \n \n \n"},{title:"My Thoughts on Keeping Thoughts",frontmatter:{title:"My Thoughts on Keeping Thoughts",description:"My first ever blog post.",date:"2011-03-01T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Memories"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"My Thoughts on Keeping Thoughts"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"My first ever blog post."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/My-Thoughts-on-Keeping-Thoughts.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"My Thoughts on Keeping Thoughts"},{property:"og:description",content:"My first ever blog post."},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/My-Thoughts-on-Keeping-Thoughts.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2011-03-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"My Thoughts on Keeping Thoughts"},{itemprop:"description",content:"My first ever blog post."}]},regularPath:"/blog/2011/3/My-Thoughts-on-Keeping-Thoughts.html",relativePath:"blog/2011/3/My-Thoughts-on-Keeping-Thoughts.md",key:"v-6b0a25a5",path:"/blog/2011/3/My-Thoughts-on-Keeping-Thoughts.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  nakedlogic.blogspot.com . The exact date is unknown, so the day is for chronological order. \n I never was one to keep a journal. growing up, I was always encouraged to do so, but I was too paranoid to try. I've always believed that my mind was the only safe sanctuary I have, so why risk the security of my thoughts, if I could simply reflect on them in my own head? \n Either way, I never was the sentimental type. Thats something I quickly discovered about myself. I don't own very many possessions. I usually notice different types of people, and one of the ways I categorize them is by past, present and future. I know people who live in the past, and people who only concern themselves with the present. me, I think the best type of people are the ones who are grounded in the present and look towards the future. \n So while I never did write down my thoughts, I've always wanted to. I believe expressing ones self is naturally therapeutic. The thing about doing this though, is that that I'll inevitably look back and roll my eyes at everything I've posted. \n \n \n"},{title:"People I Know With Blogs",frontmatter:{title:"People I Know With Blogs",description:"My young mind's thoughts on people I knew with blogs.",date:"2011-03-11T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Memories"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"People I Know With Blogs"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"My young mind's thoughts on people I knew with blogs."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/People-I-Know-With-Blogs.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"People I Know With Blogs"},{property:"og:description",content:"My young mind's thoughts on people I knew with blogs."},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/People-I-Know-With-Blogs.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2011-03-11T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"People I Know With Blogs"},{itemprop:"description",content:"My young mind's thoughts on people I knew with blogs."}]},regularPath:"/blog/2011/3/People-I-Know-With-Blogs.html",relativePath:"blog/2011/3/People-I-Know-With-Blogs.md",key:"v-2e86387d",path:"/blog/2011/3/People-I-Know-With-Blogs.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  nakedlogic.blogspot.com .

I know I can't be mad at him, since it's his guitar and he has the right to do whatever the heck he wants to do with it. It's just a pity that now the electric guitar is a useless guitar.

The exact date is unknown, so the day is for chronological order. \n \n I found this while looking through some old files in the back of my drawers. Since I'll be going off to college in a couple of months, my aunt decided to get me a little file organizer of sorts to keep all my important documents in. At the time I kept my high school transcript and test scores tucked away in a drawer. Every school year, I'd dump all the papers in my backpack into this drawer. \n This was from my AP Psychology class during my Junior year. I remember my teacher, Mrs. Ruiz, being the happiest and most likable person ever. She was one of those teachers that you had no trouble talking with about things aside from school. It was close to the last day of school, and she decided to do something fun with the class. Those that wanted to got out a piece of paper, wrote their name on it, and passed it around the room. Then each person would write something nice about that person anonymously. Looking back now, I'm glad I decided to do this. \n Seeing it again, it made me realize that you really never know when your going to make someones day. It wasn't even like a smile that made someone feel better that day. This was almost a year ago, and it found its way back to me today. I never will know when I'm going to make someones day (well let's be honest, some days you will.

I borrowed Matt's sister's bike, and everybody else had their own bikes. We went out while it was still dark, but as we continued on it got brighter. It was such a gorgeous morning. \n We met up with Andrew at the overpass in order to see the sunrise, but we got bored waiting for it and continued on towards the town center. There we pretended we were all on light-bikes and rode around trying to cut each other off. It was awesome. There was no one in sight and the sun was just starting to be visible. \n We continued on towards Dunkin Donuts and we each got a donut. The rest of the time we just biked around until we ended up home. We got back at 8 and had biked 15 miles. It felt so great. We made eggs for breakfast and I whipped up a little breakfast burrito. Afterwards we watched a batman video, hung out, had burgers for lunch and then Matt's dad took us out to get ice cream.

At the time all the bands but Manchester Orchestra were announced for the lineup, but I was still impressed with all the good bands that'd be there. When I saw Coral Skies tweet that they'd added Manchester Orchestra, that just made it even more exciting. \n My siblings: Adam, Eric, Carlos, Meli and I, left Orlando around nine and drove about an hour and a half to Tampa. We got all hyped up on the way there as we listened to the CD Meli had burned. It had a lot of the bands' music we were going to see. \n This was my second time coming to the Midflorida Credit Union Amphitheater, and my second music festival. I came here before for my first music festival, Big Guava. This time they only had two stages: the main one (Scion Stage) and one of the side ones (Sunrise Stage). Throughout the day we'd go back and forth between them for each show. It wouldn't have been too bad if there was a little more to do between shows besides getting food finding a good seat for the next show. Big Guava had a lot of carnival rides you could go on during the festival. \n As soon as the gates opened and we got in, we checked out the merch tents and ogled all the cool band tees. Behind the tent was a line for the band signing table where Bombay Bicycle Club was already signing posters. In order to get in line for it, you had to purchase a poster, cd or whatever so you could get a ticket for the band you wanted to have sign your goods. Well I didn't know that, so by the time I got my poster, the Cage The Elephant and Bombay Bicycle Club tickets had already been taken, so I got aManchester Orchestra ticket for later on in the evening. \n Good Graeff was the first band that played on the Sunrise stage and they were really good! I'd never heard of them before but you can bet your buns I'll be listening to them now. Wild Cub and Tokyo Police Club also played on that stage and they were both equally good. I recognized a lot of the songs we listened to in the car ride over when they played them, too. \n There was plenty of food trucks to choose from and we got some really good nachos from Street Surfer that we all shared. I got to see a little bit of Bleachers before I left to get in line to get my poster signed. \n While I was waiting, I asked one of the security staff members if it was possible to get at the end of the line for one of the other bands signing if we didn't have their ticket. He said if it got too deep, they'd have to cap it off, but otherwise I could try. \n ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) \n I got to the line pretty early so I was close to the front and was able to grab a picture with Andy before they started enforcing the \"no-selfies\" rule. I also nerded out and told him how big a fan I was of the band and that it was my third time seeing them live. \n \n I missed the Bleachers' finale, but I could hear it even from the line I was in, and it sounded really good. I wasn't prepared for how amazing City And Colour would be! THEY WERE AMAZING! \n There was a lady behind me that kept telling \"Chris\" to stand up because apparently they'd traveled over two hundred miles to see them. She was also getting mad that people were just talking while they were playing. To be fair though, we were all in the general admission seats and not in the pit. It was unfortunate that our seats for the Bombay Bicycle Club show were a little far from the stage. We probably could have gone into the pit, but I enjoyed the performance from where I sat regardless. \n We got some funnel cake and spent a little bit of time chilling on the lawn seating. Manchester Orchestra played later at the Sunrise Stage. They were just as epic as they always are and I'm glad two of my brothers got to see them for the first time. I left before they finished so I could hopefully get my poster signed by Cage The Elephant. \n I got to the end of the line and after a few more people got behind me they capped it off. Needless to say I was feeling pretty happy that I'd be able to finally meet the band. Once I got to the front of the line, I asked them if they were still friends with Morning Teleportation and if they were still coming out with music. I'd first heard of Morning Teleportation when Cage The Elephant posted their  friend's new music video  on their facebook page. I instantly fell in love with the band and actually went and saw them as my first concert. \n He said they were still coming out with music and that I should look for it sometime next year! I was pretty stoked. When I reached the end of the table where Matt was signing, I told him that this was my second time seeing them play and how out of all the bands I've seen play, they had the best live performance. Matt thanked me and said he hoped they'd be just as good tonight. \n We got some funnel cake before the last two shows. In my humble opinion, adding Julian Casablancas + The Voidz to the lineup was a mistake. It really didn't fit with the theme Coral Skies had presented so far, and their performance was probably the worst one that day. My brother and I went up to the lawn to watch from their because it was just way too noisy to listen to from where we were seated. \n Fortunately as soon as Cage The Elephant came on stage, he said \"fuck that shit\" and made everybody move up. We managed to make it to the seats that were right behind the pit and that's where we jammed all night. \n He started off things right with \"Spiderhead\" and every song he played sounded like it was the encore song. At one point he did try to crowd surf, but the pit sucked and they couldn't even keep him up. I felt like he was off his game since there were some shrill parts of a couple of songs he had to rely on the backtrack to sing for him. I'm guessing it's because touring with a setlist like theirs with as much energy as he puts into it can quickly tire him out. \n Despite that, it was still the best show that night. I had a blast rocking out and jumping around even if it was in the seats. I enjoyed every minute of Cage The Elephant's show and sang along with all of my favorite songs by them (which was all of them). By the time they finished their encore with \"Shake Me Down\", I was exhausted. I had spent the whole day listening to great music and hanging out with the people I love. I killed my voice and I was pretty sure I needed medical attention after how hard I was jamming, but considering everything I got from Coral Skies, I can easily say it was all worth it. \n \n \n"},{title:"Update Time",frontmatter:{title:"Update Time",description:"A time skip.",date:"2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Goals","New Year's Resolution"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"Update Time"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A time skip."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2014/2/5/Update-Time.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Update Time"},{property:"og:description",content:"A time skip."},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2014/2/5/Update-Time.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Goals"},{property:"article:tag",content:"New Year's Resolution"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Update Time"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A time skip."}]},regularPath:"/blog/2014/2/5/Update-Time.html",relativePath:"blog/2014/2/5/Update-Time.md",key:"v-015dc9c5",path:"/blog/2014/2/5/Update-Time.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  christoferpadilla.tumblr.com . \n Man, it's been almost a year and a half.

It was fun, and I want to make a game that's as fun as the original was for me. No matter how many times I've searched for this game, I cannot find any evidence that it ever existed, so I'm gonna use my creative liberties for all their worth. \"Pretty straight-forward plan,\" if I do says so myself. \n I have some pretty lofty ambitions for this game, so I've been doing a lot of groundwork with the engine I want. Since I've been using C# a lot, I've absolutely become enamored with the language. Therefore I've decided to use OpenTK with my game, as an open source wrapper library for OpenGL. \n I've still just barely begun work on it and I'm already starting to think about art assets, story, music, merchandise, theme parks -- okay maybe not story. But if I had to choose one thing I'd want for this game is music by Colin Stetson.

It’s been a little over two years since my last update, and a lot has happened since then to be honest. First of all… I’m doing pretty good. \n I feel like I’ve finally gotten to the point in my life where I’m starting to see the results of all the time, effort and energy I’ve put into myself; making myself a better person, being open minded and listening to others advice. For that, I’m truly thankful for all the wonderful people who’ve come into my life in any capacity and who I’ve had relationships with, however fleeting they may have been. Every person that I meet and share experiences with has had a direct impact on who I am today and how I’ve grown. These connections are really a beautiful thing and it’s something that is often times taken for granted, so I want to take this time once more to express my appreciation for all my friends and family. \n Part of the reason why it’s been two years since my last update was because although I didn’t quite realize it, I was kind of a mess. There’s a term in psychology that I’ve come to love called ‘cognitive dissonance’. It occurs when your thoughts are not in line with your actions. Although I had a good job and was living comfortably, I didn’t feel like I was actually moving forward with my goals or career. My work plus the commute was taking up a majority of my time and it started to wear me thin. I would find myself coming home feeling drained and before long miserable. There were a few other things in my life that were causing me distress but thankfully I was able to identify each issue and start to work on them. \n I’d been taking part time classes while I was working, but it was very difficult considering how far my job was from campus. I decided that in order to continue down my desired path I needed to make a major life change. I quit my job of two years to return to school full time agan. This brought about the start of a lot of positive changes in my life. \n When I quit I didn’t have another job lined up. All I had was a semester full of classes, an embarrassingly small amount of savings and a financial aid check to look forward to once classes started. But I found I had more of what I consider to be the most precious resource available: time. Just thinking about the straight up bliss I experienced from having more time to myself to stop and smell the roses makes my wanna cry; I was happy, truly happy again. \n Anyway, I felt like I got a second chance starting up school full time again. In an effort to improve my social life I started being active in clubs. I met so many awesome people who’ve enriched my lives since then. Honestly there is too many things I’m thankful for to list them all, but I’ve really felt blessed to have my friends and family above all. \n Happy Thanksgiving! \n \n \n"},{title:"Richard Serra Transversal #2",frontmatter:{title:"Richard Serra Transversal #2",description:"The first time I encountered Richard Serra's work.",date:"2014-08-11T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Art","Memories"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/richard-serra-transversal-2.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Richard Serra Transversal #2"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"The first time I encountered Richard Serra's work."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/richard-serra-transversal-2.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2014/8/11/Richard-Serra-Transversal-2.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Richard Serra Transversal #2"},{property:"og:description",content:"The first time I encountered Richard Serra's work."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/richard-serra-transversal-2.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2014/8/11/Richard-Serra-Transversal-2.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2014-08-11T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Art"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Richard Serra Transversal #2"},{itemprop:"description",content:"The first time I encountered Richard Serra's work."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/richard-serra-transversal-2.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2014/8/11/Richard-Serra-Transversal-2.html",relativePath:"blog/2014/8/11/Richard-Serra-Transversal-2.md",key:"v-533ed417",path:"/blog/2014/8/11/Richard-Serra-Transversal-2.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  christoferpadilla.tumblr.com . \n \n This was my favorite piece I saw at the Orlando Museum of Art today. \n \n \n"},{title:"Untitled",frontmatter:{title:"Untitled",description:"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year",date:"2014-12-24T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Memories"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/beautifulsouls.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Untitled"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/beautifulsouls.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2016/12/24/Untitled.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Untitled"},{property:"og:description",content:"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/beautifulsouls.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2016/12/24/Untitled.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2014-12-24T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Untitled"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/beautifulsouls.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2016/12/24/Untitled.html",relativePath:"blog/2016/12/24/Untitled.md",key:"v-9c1a406a",path:"/blog/2016/12/24/Untitled.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  christoferpadilla.tumblr.com . \n \n So grateful to all the beautiful souls I’ve met this year and for all the positive influence they’ve had on my life.

So I decided to quit Facebook and make my own blog. In my last post to Facebook, I declared you can create a blog 100% for free and I promised myself that one of my first blog posts would be how to do so. \n So here we are. There are a few requirements that I needed for my blog, which is why I settled on using  Vuepress . I came up with these requirements by working backwards from what I would want in an ideal blogging solution. \n \n Everything must be free. \n Blog posts should be created as easily as committing a markdown file. \n My blog should be extensible with  Vue . \n \n Vuepress seems to meet all of these requirements so I decided to just use it out of the box. If you are familiar with Github, you can copy my blog to start your own  here . \n Otherwise, I'm going to cover the general instructions to set up your own blog, without going too deeply in the specifics. \n Creating your first Vuepress site \n To start, I basically just followed the excellent guide I found  here . It does a great job introducing you to Vuepress enough for you to begin customizing your blog yourself. It says you should have a blog up and running in around 10 minutes, but I think that's a little generous. \n Still, it goes over everything you really need to know and it shouldn't take you too long to get set up. It then barely goes over how to deploy your blog as a website, so that is the step I will cover in more detail next. \n Using Github pages to host your blog for free \n The gist of how this works is as follows: You will use Github to host the source code of your blog for you. Github offers a feature called  Github pages , which we will then utilize to turn your source code into a real website. \n The way this works is that you build your website from the source code, which generates the output in a folder called  dist . You then upload that folder to github on a special  gh-pages  branch, which is how Github pages knows where to find your static site (basically the end product, or the final html file that is your entire blog). This site is now available for the world wide web to access thru a url like  mywebsite.github.io/blog . If you want to spend money on your site, you can buy a domain name via  GoDaddy  or  Google Domains  to have your  mywebsite.github.io/blog  url redirect to a cooler name like  myadventures.blog . You can get domains for pretty cheap. (My  christofer.rocks  domain was only $15 for 1 year.) \n Ok. If you're still with me, here's how to do it. \n \n Create a  Github  account. \n Host your code in a  new repository . \n Go to your repository settings. For example, mine is at  https://github.com/cpadilla/christofer-rocks/settings , although you obviously can't access my settings; your url should be something similar. \n Scroll down to the Github Pages settings. Under source, you want to change the branch dropdown to  gh-pages . \n Follow the steps on the official  Vuepress documentation  page on deploying to GitHub pages. You pretty much just need to create the following shell script and run it. \n \n #!/usr/bin/env sh \nabort on errors \n set   -e \nbuild \n npm  run docs:build\nnavigate into the build output directory \n cd  docs/.vuepress/dist\nif you are deploying to a custom domain \necho 'www.example.com' > CNAME \n\n git  init\n git   add   -A \n git  commit  -m   'deploy' \nif you are deploying to https://<USERNAME>.github.io \ngit push -f git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git master \nif you are deploying to https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO> \ngit push -f git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git master:gh-pages \n\n cd  -\n \n That's all there is to it! It's not that bad at all and now creating blog posts is as easy as creating a new markdown file and deploying it. Keep in mind that what is deployed in the  gh-pages  repo doesn't necessarily match up with what you commit to your main github repo that contains the source code. \n Finally, if you do decide to spend money and obtain a custom domain, you can follow  these  steps to redirect your GitHub page to your new domain. Don't forget to uncomment out the relevant line in your deploy script! \n Hopefully, this guide will help you create your own blog and stake your claim in internet territory without the need of social media platforms. This is great because not only can you host all types of media, but you can also use Vue and HTML to create and share unique components as well such as panoramas, tweets and other widgets. It's truly the wild west of the web! \n \n \n"},{title:"I Am 18 Years Old Today.",frontmatter:{title:"I Am 18 Years Old Today.",description:"Happy Birthday to me!",date:"2011-03-15T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Memories"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/birthdayprogram.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"I Am 18 Years Old Today."},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Happy Birthday to me!"},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/birthdayprogram.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/I-am-18-years-old-today..html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"I Am 18 Years Old Today."},{property:"og:description",content:"Happy Birthday to me!"},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/birthdayprogram.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/I-am-18-years-old-today..html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2011-03-15T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"I Am 18 Years Old Today."},{itemprop:"description",content:"Happy Birthday to me!"},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/birthdayprogram.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2011/3/I-am-18-years-old-today..html",relativePath:"blog/2011/3/I-am-18-years-old-today..md",key:"v-15347aab",path:"/blog/2011/3/I-am-18-years-old-today..html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  nakedlogic.blogspot.com .

I got my first \"Happy Birthday!\" at 5:35 am. this morning. I had a small lime cake patty for breakfast. I finished my Inception painting today, and one of my best friends, Vanessa, made me a bracelet. I think that was the best birthday present I've received that I can remember. \n I just wish my sister, Christina, had as good of a birthday was I was having. I felt sorry for her.

I remember we started talking about some of the more interesting stories in Marvel comics. I don't even remember what stories, by I do remember being enamored with the the  lore  behind them. \n At the time, my favorite super hero was spider man. Perhaps because of the close similarities to the super-ness of spiders in nature. I've always been interested in a spider's ability to produce  silk  and spin webs. I remember fondly my brother and I would draw our own spider man comics. \n Recently, I found the same spark that kindled my love of comics as when I was on that hike in a video I found on TikTok describing some of the new developments in the DC universe. \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n Thus, I went down a rabbit hole, exploring the DC universe. Up until this point, the only comic I had been keeping up with was  Dragon Ball Super , which had just finished a dissapointing arc, but still offered a promising future. There was also a  Death Note One-Shot Special , which was amazing but short-lived. \n Anyway, I decided to go visit a local comic store to check out the next issue of Death Metal, which was the series that continued the Darkest Knight story line. I haven't really explored Wilmington since I've moved here in August, mostly due to the pandemic. \n While I was there, I picked up a copy of one of my all-time favorite comic: WATCHMEN. It is a masterpiece. I started watching the HBO series recently, which I think is decent so far. \n But the original WATCHMEN comic is a graphic novel I wanted to have in my collection, just like I have certain comic-inspired records in my collection, such as MF DOOM's  MM..FOOD , Czarface's  Every Hero Needs a Villain , and Wu-Tang Clan's  Protect Ya Neck . \n Upon reading the forward, I discovered that it had been  inspired  by Bob Dylan and his song Desolation Row. \n \n At Midnight all the agents \n and the superhuman crew \n Come out and round up \n everyone who knows more \n than they do. \n \n Interesting. \n \n \n \n"},{title:"A Remarkable Coincidence of Inspiration",frontmatter:{title:"A Remarkable Coincidence of Inspiration",date:"2020-12-29T00:00:00.000Z",description:"An interesting observation made in defining inspiration.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Definitions","Inspiration","Recursion"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/mystery.png"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"A Remarkable Coincidence of Inspiration"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"An interesting observation made in defining inspiration."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/mystery.png"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2020/12/29/A_Remarkable_Coincidence_of_Inspiration.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"A Remarkable Coincidence of Inspiration"},{property:"og:description",content:"An interesting observation made in defining inspiration."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/mystery.png"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2020/12/29/A_Remarkable_Coincidence_of_Inspiration.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2020-12-29T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Definitions"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Inspiration"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Recursion"},{itemprop:"name",content:"A Remarkable Coincidence of Inspiration"},{itemprop:"description",content:"An interesting observation made in defining inspiration."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/mystery.png"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2020/12/29/A_Remarkable_Coincidence_of_Inspiration.html",relativePath:"blog/2020/12/29/A_Remarkable_Coincidence_of_Inspiration.md",key:"v-163c49e5",path:"/blog/2020/12/29/A_Remarkable_Coincidence_of_Inspiration.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:' A Remarkable Coincidence of Inspiration \n I have trained in the art of computer science for a while now. It is a science of computation theory and systems design. \n Programming is fundamentally the art of giving precise instructions to a complex system. In my years of study, I have found many similarities between the precise language of computer instructions and the development of my own set of guiding principles to live by. \n This blog is a place where I can reflect upon my observations of the world; Indeed, it is a reflection of who I am. \n For so long as I have been interested in developing software, so too have I kept careful accounts of my life experiences in the form of journaling. The first and foremost similarity between these two disciplines is the use of the english language. I strive to be as honest as I can be in both practices for the sake of integrity. Integrity is critical to any system. While I should be strict in addressing faults in software, I should still be gentle when evaluating my own faults. \n Anyway, I often find I must re-evaluate my premises, especially including the language that I use. Therefore, I reassure myself simply by defining words. \n As it so happened, I found myself feeling profoundly inspired after a deeply personal hallucinogenic experience. In computer science, recursion is an interesting concept of abstract self reflection. Sometimes I\'ll notice the meaning in a word (or multiple words) will have patterns of recursion (and fractals!). \n So I wondered: what is inspiration? \n I said, "Hey, Google: define inspiration." \n "Inspiration has 3 different meanings. Starting with the most common one: inspiration can be used as a noun to mean the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative, similarly to creativity and inventiveness. Is that the meaning you were looking for?" \n "No." \n "Alright. Inspiration can also be used as a noun to mean a sudden brilliant, creative, or timely idea, similarly to \'bright idea\' or \'brilliant idea\' . Is that the meaning you were looking for?" \n "No" \n "Alright. Finally, inspiration can be used as a noun to mean the drawing in of breath, as in \'The crackling sounds of inhalation could be heard thru the stethescope.\'" \n Interesting. I had just done some yoga for the first time in what felt like forever and I was definitely feeling inspired. \n Coincidentally, I said, "Hey, Google: define coincidence." \n "Coincidence has 3 different meanings. Starting with the most common one, coincidence can be used as a noun to mean a remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances without apparent causal connection. Is that the meaning you were looking for?" \n "No." \n "OK. Coincidence can also be used as a noun to mean: correspondence in nature or in time of occurrence, as in \'The coincidence of interest between the mining companies and certain politicians\'. Is that the meaning you had in mind?" \n Interesting. "No". \n "OK. Finally, coincidence can be used as a noun to mean: the presence of ionizing particles or other objects in two or more detectors simultaneously, or of two or more signals simultaneously in a circuit." \n I found this fascinating. There seems to be some kind of  recurrence  here. A correspondence? \n Something that\'s always stuck with me is a  Joe Rogan clip  where he wonders if maybe ideas are living things as well. I find language to be highly conductive of ideas. \n Curiously, in being reminded of the Joe Rogan podcast, I found episode #1236 to be missing. \n \n \n \n'},{title:"2021 New Year's Resolution",frontmatter:{title:"2021 New Year's Resolution",date:"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A look back on 2020 and my new year's resolutions.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["New Year's Resolution"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/IMG_20200307_125647_2.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"2021 New Year's Resolution"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A look back on 2020 and my new year's resolutions."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/IMG_20200307_125647_2.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/1/2021_New_Year's_Resolution.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"2021 New Year's Resolution"},{property:"og:description",content:"A look back on 2020 and my new year's resolutions."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/IMG_20200307_125647_2.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/1/2021_New_Year's_Resolution.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"New Year's Resolution"},{itemprop:"name",content:"2021 New Year's Resolution"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A look back on 2020 and my new year's resolutions."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/IMG_20200307_125647_2.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/1/2021_New_Year's_Resolution.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/1/2021_New_Year's_Resolution.md",key:"v-658cbd4d",path:"/blog/2021/1/1/2021_New_Year's_Resolution.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" 2021 New Year's Resolution \n 2020 was a rough year for me. \n I was hospitalized after a psychotic episode back in March. I spent my birthday in a psych ward. After that I lost my job which I had just started at the beginning of the year. \n This was right as the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread and quarantining became the new way of life. My mental health took a serious nosedive during this time. I was unemployed for 6 months looking for a job during a pandemic. I had to sell all of my bitcoin just to get by, which was a shame in retrospect since that was around the time it was the lowest price this year. \n In an unfortunate series of events, I spent my life savings (nearly $20k) on a new mustang. This was right after I got out of the hospital in Daytona. I wasn't prescribed any new medication so I have no idea why they let me go. Still being in my delusional state of mind, I spent the money I had taken out to purchase bitcoin on a car to get home instead. \n As if that wasn't bad enough, I foolishly \"rented out\" my car to make a quick buck while I tried to sell it for good. Then the person who I rented it out to wrecked it and ghosted me. Worst case scenario achieved. \n Finally, things started to turn around when I found a new job in North Carolina. I decided it would be best to move up there from Florida and get a fresh start. \n Things have been going pretty good since then and I finally feel now as if I'm back on track to accomplishing my goals. One of those goals was to finish my blog. And so I have! \n 2020 wasn't all bad. The start of the year I had an amazing time camping with friends and celebrating my brother Carlos' birthday at the Okeechobee music festival. \n \n It blows my mind that the last time I made New Year's Resolutions was back in 2017. At least according to my last blog post. \n Here are my goals for 2021. \n \n Accumulate 1 full bitcoin. \n Develop a working prototype of my  Space Pirates  game. \n Lose 30lbs. \n Take up kiteboaring. \n \n I think those are the 4 goals I want to focus on. It incorporates budgeting my finances, dieting, and dedicating myself to a productive hobby of mine as well as learning a new one. \n I'm very optimistic about this next year. \n \n \n"},{title:"Reflections at Interfaces",frontmatter:{title:"Reflections at Interfaces",date:"2020-12-30T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A second interesting coincidence noticed in defining interface.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Inspiration","Astronomy","Light"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Flash-and-RAM.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Reflections at Interfaces"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A second interesting coincidence noticed in defining interface."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Flash-and-RAM.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2020/12/30/Reflections_at_interfaces.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Reflections at Interfaces"},{property:"og:description",content:"A second interesting coincidence noticed in defining interface."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Flash-and-RAM.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2020/12/30/Reflections_at_interfaces.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2020-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Inspiration"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Astronomy"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Light"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Reflections at Interfaces"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A second interesting coincidence noticed in defining interface."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Flash-and-RAM.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2020/12/30/Reflections_at_interfaces.html",relativePath:"blog/2020/12/30/Reflections_at_interfaces.md",key:"v-16361776",path:"/blog/2020/12/30/Reflections_at_interfaces.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" Reflections at Interfaces \n I was reading a book my sister in law let me borrow called  To Measure the Sky . It's an introduction to observational astronomy, and I find learning about light interesting and useful. \n I've been thinking about  my last blog post , especially how it helps me organize my thoughts and make reflections on and of myself. It's like rather than looking into a mirror, I can see my reflection in the words I type. My computer is the mirror I use for self reflection beyond just my physical appearance; my reflection in my minds eye. \n The first few pages of the book I'm reading explain the modes of behavior of light. The summarization of the wave theory of light mentioned \"Light exhibits all the properties of classical, well-behaved waves, namely: reflection at interfaces...\" \n Huh. I thought I knew what interface meant. In programming terms, it usually describes how a class or function will behave. It can also mean a point at which humans interact with a computer, such as a touch-screen interface or a graphical user interface. I hadn't really heard the word used in the context of the behavior of light. I set out to answer the question: what does it mean when light reflects at an interface? \n \"Hey Google: define interface.\" \n \"Interface has 4 different meanings. Starting with the most common one, interface can be used as a noun to mean a point where 2 systems, subjects, organizations, etc., meet and interact.\" \n Another coincidence. I previously described myself as a complex system, similar to a computer. I would like to compare myself as a being of light, and a well-behaved one at that. Maybe all this self-reflection I am doing is in an abstract sense just light reflecting off of complex systems. In the case of writing my blog, it is the light of my thoughts reflecting at the interface of a computer. \n But the complex system isn't necessarily the computer. It's the words, or rather the language that is reflecting my thoughts. So far I count 4 complex systems in this process of self reflection: body and mind (self), my computer, and the words (language). Between this arrangement, my ideas are reflected in a recursive process of self reflection. This complex system is my blog. \n Comparing my blog to journaling, we can see the simliarities. In this case, I count 3 complex systems: my body and  mind (self), and my journal entries (language). This (not so) complex system is my journal. \n Therefore, I have two backup systems beyond my own thoughts that facilitate self-reflection. Coincidentally, I notice the same recurrence of backup systems in nature. For example, two lungs, two hemispheres of the brain, two nostrils, two eyes, etc. Even  Tesla's self driving computer  has redundancy. \n \n Interesting. I like to think we are more like computer systems than you would suspect. If so, the ability to code and self reflect are powerful skills, indeed. \n \n \n"},{title:"Queries Into the 4th State of Matter",frontmatter:{title:"Queries Into the 4th State of Matter",date:"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",description:"When I was energized midslumber to find an answer.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Definitions","Inspiration","Light"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"Queries Into the 4th State of Matter"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"When I was energized midslumber to find an answer."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/1/Queries_into_the_4th_state_of_matter.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Queries Into the 4th State of Matter"},{property:"og:description",content:"When I was energized midslumber to find an answer."},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/1/Queries_into_the_4th_state_of_matter.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Definitions"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Inspiration"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Light"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Queries Into the 4th State of Matter"},{itemprop:"description",content:"When I was energized midslumber to find an answer."}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/1/Queries_into_the_4th_state_of_matter.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/1/Queries_into_the_4th_state_of_matter.md",key:"v-84411da2",path:"/blog/2021/1/1/Queries_into_the_4th_state_of_matter.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:' Queries Into the 4th State of Matter \n I stirred from my slumber. Like a jolt of electricity, I suddenly had an idea. Despite being groggy and half-awake, I was energized to pose the following query. \n "Hey Google. What happens when current is turned on itself?" \n "On the website planned parenthood.org they say, \'Your penis or clitoris may get erect, engorged, and sensitive, and you may feel wetness on your vulva or vagina, or on the tip of your penis.\'" \n What? \n I was confused. It must have understood my query as being "turned on", as in arousal. A quick google search confirmed my suspicions. \n That wasn\'t exactly what I meant. I was more interested in how lightning is formed. This was the vision that took hold of me when I was energized to pose my query. I imagined that was how plasma was formed. Plasma, as in the 4th state of matter, or how lightning is formed in a thundercloud. \n Why was I interested in the answer to this query however? In order to understand how I arrived to the state of mind I was in that produced such an energizing thought. Indeed, not only had it woken me up, but it gave me enough energy to get out of bed and write down my thoughts as well. Such a powerful thought must be significant enough to at least record. \n Therefore, in order to better understand how I arrived to the state of mind that facilitated such an idea, I looked into the most recent videos I had watched on YouTube before going to bed.

It came out in 2012, which was right after I graduated high school. Since the movie follows the story of high school seniors, I found it especially relatable at that point in my life. \n The story of developing super powers and being catapulted from an otherwise mundane and average life is a relatable fantasy that I'm sure many teenager's like myself indulged in. In many ways, I saw the same struggles I experienced in the life of the main character; themes like isolation, alienation and unhealthy coping habits are all explored thru the lens of a troubled teenager via  found-footage  film. (Interestingly, this film technique is mostly used for the horror genre but it works well for this movie by creating a dichotomy between the boring home-made footage of a loser and the surreal experience of discovering supernatural powers.) \n Chronicle \n First, let's define  chronicle .  According to Google ,  chronicle  can be used as a noun to mean a factual written account of important or historical events in the order of their occurrence. It can also be used as a verb to mean record (a related series of events) in a factual and detailed way. \n So begins the premise of the movie as we are introduced to Andrew Detmer, played by one of my favorite actors,  Dane DeHaan . Andrew has just bought a new camera and is recording himself in the mirror with it. He's locked in his room, which is about as messy as you would expect from a late teenage boy's room and he handles the camera with the anxious and almost self-conscious energy that defined a generation of  Myspace profile pictures . \n Andrew proclaims that he's going to start recording things \"from now on\" as his father bangs on the door. The scene implies that he's acquired his camera as some form of insurance or self-preservation, and as we are taken on a tour of his life, we begin to see why: Andrew Detmer is a loser. Bullied at school and abused at home, he doesn't have a lot going for him. \n Aside from his bedridden mother, his one social lifeline seems to be his cousin Matt. Like most stoners, Matt is easy-going and likeable, almost the opposite of Andrew, who is withdrawn and anti-social. We see they get a long well enough in a car ride scene where Matt drives Andrew to school as part of their routine. Their differences are highlighted as Matt talks about his interest in philosophy and how he's started to turn to altruism. \n \"What's altruism?\" \n It's interesting to see this brief but insightful dynamic into their lives. I remember being a part of the Philosophy club in high school and college as this was a period in my life marked by a greater intensity of self-reflection and discovery. In a way we can see that this is part of the reason for Andrew's camera; whether he realizes it or not, for him it's a tool of self-reflection. We see this at the end of the day as he grins over his computer, re-playing footage he's captured of his admittedly mundane life. \n Here, he has complete control over the perspective of the camera and in a sense, his life. Control of which we see he's desperate for, we see, as his father comes in and smacks him for his earlier insolence of locking his room's door. \n Andrew then uncharacteristically decides to accept his cousin's previous invitation to a party that night. He of course brings his camera. \n It's at this party we're introduced to Matt's love interest, Casey, which serves as an interesting vehicle for his own self-reflection as he tries to get closer to her. She is a blogger, which conveniently justifies her carrying around a camera everywhere she goes (mostly to serve as a second perspective for the found-footage film, no doubt). \n We hit the peak of Andrew Detmer's pathetic life at the low point of the party for him, where we find him outside, crying, his camera resting on the ground. \n Here is where popular student Steve Montgomery finds him and coaxes him to bring his camera to record something cool him and Matt found. (Steve is very clearly high at this point.) \n The discovery they find is the beginning of their new-found powers of telekinesis. \n Power \n The story develops in a  slice of life  pace with the three young men growing stronger with their abilities as they test the boundaries of what they're capable of. \n What's interesting to me is not so much the development of their powers as is the character development of Andrew and Matt. (I'm gonna be honest and say Steve doesn't have much character development worth speaking of.) Personally, between the three of them, I could relate to positive traits in each of them, as I'm sure was intended to raise sympathy with the audience. \n In Steve, we see a go-getter. He's at the top of his game and has so much going for him. He represents the realized version of our idealized self. \n In Matt, we see a fulfilled social life. It's implied he's always been popular, so much so that it might be taken for granted. This doesn't seem to impress the girl he's interested in, however, and so we see his love life as a reflection of our own; a love unrequited despite our best qualities. This is how Casey acts as a fulcrum in Matt's journey of introspection: his character arc is defined as the transformation from a care-free childhood to the adulthood of responsibility. Most of this responsibility comes in the form of keeping his cousin morally aligned with his altruistic philosophy. \n Finally, we have the most interesting character development in Andrew. It is interesting mostly because he harbours the greatest character flaws. \n Immediately, we see that Andrew has a mental affinity to these new powers. Where all else in his life is mediocre or below-average, in this new power he is successful. As his confidence in his abilities grow, he no longer films hiding behind the camera, but rather uses his telekinesis to orbit the camera around himself. Finally, the one area of his life he can control, and we see it's effect in the finesse of his camera control. This could also be symbolic of him coming out of his shell as he begins to like what he sees through his tool of self  reflection . \n As the story continues, we begin to notice his  psychopathic  tendencies: he continues to fixate on his camera as his mother cries out in pain in the other room; he casually flicks aside an annoying vehicle, critically injuring the passenger; he methodically dismembers a spider. \n \n Despite now spending almost every day hanging out with Matt and Steven, he still has a hard time reaching out to them about his home life. At one point he asks Matt \"Do you like me?\" This is often the dangerous question that resides at the depth of most teenager's sense of self-worth. \n His father still seems to be his main agitator while his mother's declining health seems to be the main stressor (if only because it's the root cause of his father's ire). His father calls him worthless and sows more doubt that his friends even care about him, again, enforcing his belief of worthlessness. This form of abuse on his self-worth seems to be the fuel to the fire that is his need to feel supreme with his powers. \n Hubris \n Slowly, the dominoes begin to fall in his life, beginning with the freak accident that resulted in Steve's death. The stability that was the trio's friendship collapses and now Andrew fall's deeper into his downward spiral of negative thought-patterns. Matt tries to reach out to him. Upset, he tries to take away Andrew's camera, literally triggering his flight response to fly away. \n We see Andrew revert back to his antisocial behaviors only now he's unrestrained by his friends' moral compasses. He still eats lunch by himself but now he also lashes out at his former bully by yanking his teeth from his skull. He documents himself talking about the technique he employed with his powers to do so, dispassionately recounting the details in clear disregard of his oppressor as a human being. \n Deeper into his  psychotic  thinking patterns he falls as he begins to fixate on the idea of becoming the \"apex predator\". \n \n A lion does not feel guilty when it kills a gazelle. You do not feel guilty when you squash an ant beneath your feet. And I think that means something. \n \n Interestingly, I've noticed that in philosophy, \"and I think that means something\" usually marks the end of a certain line of thinking. Whether a satisfactory conclusion has been achieved or it's inconceivable to continue the line of thought, it's usually a flaw on the thinkers behalf, as further reasoning (even as simple as \"but  what  does that mean?\") often yields a different conclusion. \n Finally, Matt tries to reason with him once more before throwing a punch at his cousin in frustration. This time, Andrew chooses to fight by holding his ground. He stops the punch inches from his face. It's clear now he has the advantage through his superior telekinetic powers. It is now Matt who flees. \n The story escalates to a climax when Andrew's mother dies. Untethered to any moral grounding in reality, he goes on a rampage in the city. We see the peak of his hubris displayed cinematically as he yanks dozens of the onlooking crowd's cameras into orbit around him. \n The full weight of the burden of responsibility falls on Matt's shoulders as he realizes the only way he can stop Andrew is to quickly strike him down. \n The story ends with Matt bearing his final confessions on the mountains of Tibet. Earlier in the movie, Andrew mentioned wanting to go to Tibet, where the monks are said to have reached such a high level of  enlightenment  that they could levitate. \n After relieving the burden on his soul, he wishes Andrew goodbye, leaving only the camera and the memory of his cousin behind in the snow. \n \n   \n   Hubris: excessive pride or self-confidence. In Greek tragedy, excessive pride toward or defiance of the gods, leading to nemesis. \n \n \n \n"},{title:"slow down my thoughts - Zachary Knowles",frontmatter:{title:"slow down my thoughts - Zachary Knowles",date:"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",description:'A case study on "slow down my thoughts" by Zachary Knowles.',author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Case Study","Music"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"slow down my thoughts - Zachary Knowles"},{name:"twitter:description",content:'A case study on "slow down my thoughts" by Zachary Knowles.'},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/1/slow_down_my_thoughts.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"slow down my thoughts - Zachary Knowles"},{property:"og:description",content:'A case study on "slow down my thoughts" by Zachary Knowles.'},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/1/slow_down_my_thoughts.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Case Study"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Music"},{itemprop:"name",content:"slow down my thoughts - Zachary Knowles"},{itemprop:"description",content:'A case study on "slow down my thoughts" by Zachary Knowles.'}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/1/slow_down_my_thoughts.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/1/slow_down_my_thoughts.md",key:"v-5125f385",path:"/blog/2021/1/1/slow_down_my_thoughts.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Release",slug:"release"},{level:2,title:"Discovery",slug:"discovery"},{level:2,title:"Title",slug:"title"},{level:2,title:"Lyrics",slug:"lyrics"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" slow down my thoughts \n \n   \n \n I often find myself completely enamored with a song, sometimes for days or even weeks on end. I'll have it stuck in my head and I'll play it over and over on repeat. \n I call these  case studies . \n Usually it starts with me falling in love with the song itself. The melody, the beat drop or some part of it catches my attention enough for me to play it on repeat.Then I'll look into the lyrics and I fall in love with it all over again, which is exactly what happened with Zachary Knowles  slow down my thoughts . \n Release \n The song was released on his EP  feelings  on September 25, 2018. \n Discovery \n I discovered it on spotify, probably from one of my Discover Weekly playlists, and then re-discovered it going through my liked songs. In this case, I was tripping pretty hard and I really resonated with this song. \n One line in particluar stuck out to me. \n \n yeah you prayed for me \n Title \n When I noticed how much I liked this song, I realized the song title was \"Slow down my thoughts\". I've been thinking about doing this a lot lately, especially since I just created my blog and I've had time to offload a lot of my thoughts from my headspace. Additionally, I've been reading  The Power of Now  by Eckhart Tolle and have been practicing observing my thoughts without identifying myself as them. \n The act of slowing down my thoughts is particularly significant to me as well due to my past struggles with  mental health . \n Lyrics \n Usually I'll reflect upon song lyrics via  Genius . But this time, I actually found the lyric video on YouTube since I was listening to music on YouTube on my computer instead of Spotify. This was because I was using my FreeBSD operating system which doesn't actually have spotify on it. Usually I'll control my spotify instance on my laptop, but I didn't have my streaming set up configured yet. \n Anyway, the lyrics begin with \n \n I just wanna try somethin', try somethin' new \n even if it doesn't mean that I'll get to you \n \n When listening to this at first, all I really understood was something along the lines of \"doesn't mean that I'll get to you\". Perhaps that's one of the reasons why I felt like I could relate to this song. I used to do a lot of things in an effort to \"get back to you\". I guess it's time now that I'm trying something new. \n I previously compared my thoughts as a thundercloud with thoughts manifesting like lightning, which is the same imagery that is evoked in these lyrics: \n \n all the pressure \n all the sadness \n going through my head \n try to focus \n i can't help it \n put it on you instead \n \n Like lightning, sometimes I can't control them and they eventually return \"back to you\". Perhaps that's why I need to ground myself through meditation more often. Like a lightning rod, I can redirect my attention to things I focus on if I am indeed grounded. \n \n slow down \n is this what happens when it rains now \n \n \n \n"},{title:"The Inauguration of Joe Biden",frontmatter:{title:"The Inauguration of Joe Biden",date:"2021-01-20T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Reflecting on the Inauguration of the 46th President of the United States of America.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Politics"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Inauguration.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"The Inauguration of Joe Biden"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Reflecting on the Inauguration of the 46th President of the United States of America."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Inauguration.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/20/The-Inauguration-of-Joe-Biden.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"The Inauguration of Joe Biden"},{property:"og:description",content:"Reflecting on the Inauguration of the 46th President of the United States of America."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Inauguration.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/20/The-Inauguration-of-Joe-Biden.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-20T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Politics"},{itemprop:"name",content:"The Inauguration of Joe Biden"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Reflecting on the Inauguration of the 46th President of the United States of America."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Inauguration.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/20/The-Inauguration-of-Joe-Biden.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/20/The-Inauguration-of-Joe-Biden.md",key:"v-7d54864e",path:"/blog/2021/1/20/The-Inauguration-of-Joe-Biden.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" The Inauguration of Joe Biden \n \n I've always been interested in  politics . \n In high school, I was nominated as a candidate to participate in  Boys State . Boy's State is basically a summer program where participants act as citizens in a mock state legislature. Citizens divide into groups, elect leaders, and draft bills. \n I remember having a good relationship with the teacher of my Government class and I really enjoyed learning about the government and politics. One day, I was called out of class to the front office, where I had an interview with some guy who asked me questions such as who our state governor was, who the house majority leader was, etc. At the time, I had no idea what this was for so I wasn't prepared at all for these questions and failed the interview. \n Despite missing out on such a unique opportunity, I've always been attracted to the sacred institution of the government of The United States of America. I bought a Barnes & Noble collectible of  The Constitution  and was very impressed with the insight and foresight of the founding fathers as they designed the framework of a government that championed freedom and democracy to withstand the test of time. \n \n Politics didn't really have an impact on my life while I was in high school, but I always remember thinking the Democrats were the party of reason and the Republicans were a regressive party, resistant to change (indeed, non-progressive). Still, I remember not thinking very highly of President George W. Bush or the Iraq War. I do remember being inspired by Barack Obama's  HOPE  campaign. I remember the following day on my walk to school, black people were crying and cheering, celebrating the historic election of the first black man to the office of President. To this day, I'm proud that my first vote in a presidential election was for Obama's second term in 2012. \n The internet was wild at the time.

I was personally a very big supporter of Andrew Yang and the  community  that evolved around his grassroot campaign. \n And yet, I'm still relieved by Joe Biden's victory and now his inauguration as the 46th U.S. president. These past four years have been appalling, to say the least. I followed  headlines  in politics almost daily and I couldn't believe the audacity of President Trump and the Republican party. Blatant election stealing and outright racism on a near daily basis. It was a presidency marked by so many endless scandals that it became almost impossible to  keep track  of all the shit that went down during Trump's presidency. \n Joe Biden may not have been the candidate I wanted as the next president, but I'm undoubtedly grateful at what his presidency means for America: a return to normalcy. \n \n Boring is the new thrilling. \n Predictable is the new exciting. \n Normal is the new extraordinary. \n -  Van Jones \n \n Indeed, Van Jones (who also was a big supporter of Andrew Yang) summarizes much of my feelings about the new presidential administration. \n Today is a good day.

It more so had to do with my interest in Timothée Chalamet than just browsing and stumbling on the Netflix film, so I'll first provide some backstory as to how I became mildly obsessed with him. \n Background \n It was Fall of 2016 and I was a Junior attending the University of Central Florida. I was at a mini camping festival event called Tent City put on by a progressive activist club called Campus Peace Action. It was a fun time full of great poeple and it was easy to talk to and meet strangers at this event with how friendly everyone was. It was here that by chance I overheard a conversation being had between two guys; someone was explaining in great detail a fascinating story. I was intrigued by this tale of space-faring civilzations, humans with computer-like thinking abilities and a spice resource that could grant prescience to the user. \n I am talking, of course, about  Dune . \n Dune \n \n   \n \n Dune  was the first book in a series mostly written by Frank Herbert in 1965 (with some further expansion to the series written by his son Brian Herbert after his father's death). As such an early icon in science fiction literature, it has  inspired  many works of science fiction which are today consider staples of the genre. Works such as  Alien ,  Star Wars ,  Blade Runner , and  2001: A Space Odessy . \n There's a lot of history to  Dune  that I could go over, but I'll save it for when I inevitably do a  case study  on the film releasing later this year. \n Suffice it to say, after reading the book I had become very interested in rumblings in Hollywood of director  Denis Villeneuve  in talks to direct a movie adaptation. I had previously been impressed with his movie  Arrival  and  Blade Runner: 2049  and couldn't think of a director with a better track record for sci-fi movies. \n I felt that Star Wars had begun to turn stale and was looking forward to the development of a new sci-fi franchise. \n \"The same franchises, the same stories, the same films (literally) happening over and over again... will someone for the love of god make a new film.\" Excellent wire up  @emmaggarland Let's get hyped for Dennis Villeneuve's  #DUNE  😩🙏🏼   https://t.co/slD5Y2tfJh — Christofer (@rockzombie2)  February 27, 2020   \n Fast forward to late 2020 and the trailer for the movie drops. And it is  HYPE . \n Among the star-studded cast are some actors whom I greatly admire:  Poe Dameron  from Star Wars,  Thanos , the  psychotic assassin  from No Country for Old Men,  Aquaman , and the new  MJ  from Spider-Man. \n And yet, among these great actors is one I'm not familiar with: our boy Timmy. \n Timothée Chalamet \n Just from the  Dune  trailer alone it's obvious from the gativas with which Chalamet portrays the character of Paul Atreides the depth talent he posesses as an actor. \n As I was swept up in the hype of the new Dune movie trailer, I started doing my own research into the movie to tide me over until it's release. I joined a  book club , read some articles and looked into what information I could find on the production process of the movie. As I did this, I found myself watching more and more interviews of Chalamet and learning about his career. I found one interesting  interview between Timothée Chalamet and Emma Stone  and I was really impressed with how genuine he seemed. \n At the time, I had also received the latest issue of GQ, which featured none other than our boy Timmy. I've always enjoyed reading magazine articles as they are usually a more insightful form of interview and found the cover story on him to be no different. \n \n It turns out, Timothée Chalamet had also played a role in another film I thoroughly enjoyed:  Interstellar . He played the son at the beginning of the movie. \n I still wanted to watch something he had played a leading role in, however. I decided to go out of my way to watch a movie with surprising parallels to  Dune . \n History \n \n While  The King  is based on real events, the film itself is actually an adaptation of Shakespeare's plays dramatizing these events. The collection of these plays are called  The Henriad . \n These plays consist of Richard II, Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2 and Henry V and follows  Prince Hal , who becomes  King Henry V of England , the epic's hero. \n While some  creative liberties  have been taken, it mostly reflects the historic events of the  Hundred Years' War . \n  The King \n I've already spent a lot of time setting up pretext to the movie, so I'm only going to briefly review some of the themes I've found interesting about the movie. I'm mostly going to focus on certain scenes within the movie that touch on the following themes: The Church and it's power and influence over the crown, censorship, responsibility, and the horrors of war. \n  The Battle of Shrewsbury \n The movie begins over a bloodied battlefield, following  Henry Percy , young \"Hotspur\", across it. He stops beside a wounded soldier, slowly crawling across the field. \n \"Where go you, my friend? You're crawling in the wrong direction. That wind you feel is coming from England.\" \n He points with his sword. \n \"Scotland's that way.\" \n He stands over the man and drives his sword through him, ending his misery. \n So begins the movie: With the death of a single soldier-- a prelude to the significance of death throughout the film. \n To be continued... \n \n \n"},{title:"The Source",frontmatter:{title:"The Source",date:"2021-01-02T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Introduction to the True Black Tarot.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","The Tarot","The Source","Inspiration"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/trueblack.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"The Source"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Introduction to the True Black Tarot."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/trueblack.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/2/The_Source.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"The Source"},{property:"og:description",content:"Introduction to the True Black Tarot."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/trueblack.jpeg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/2/The_Source.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"The Tarot"},{property:"article:tag",content:"The Source"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Inspiration"},{itemprop:"name",content:"The Source"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Introduction to the True Black Tarot."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/trueblack.jpeg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/2/The_Source.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/2/The_Source.md",key:"v-033ff902",path:"/blog/2021/1/2/The_Source.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:' The Source \n \n "The Source." \n It happened  again . Another  recurrence . I blinked around, awake now that I had actually spoken my half-lucid thought aloud. \n "Hey Google, what time is it?" \n "It is 1:31 AM." \n I felt a little hungry so I got up to make a light bowl of some of the left-over taco salad I had with my family for dinner. But that wasn\'t the reason I was up. I wasn\'t energized to get up out of bed for physical sustainance. No. It was because of another idea I felt I needed to write down. \n Still orienting myself in reality from deep slumber, I tried to recall the exact thought process that had sparked my utterance. Why had I said that in my sleep? \n It was definitely a reference to source code. What was my source code? Like lightning, I had been struck with my  source  of true inspiration: \n The Tarot. \n But not just any tarot.  The True Black Tarot . \n If I were to be operated by a guiding set of principles-- indeed, a source code, it would be that of the tarot. Comparable to a  finite state machine , the tarot reflects a process of recurring patterns found in nature. The  hero\'s journey  from the The Fool to enlightenment. \n \n I\'ve always had a deep passion for reading. I read many books as a kid, especially adventure books. One of my favorites was  Pendragon . As a journalist, I strongly identified with the main character. In fact, I\'ve always considered myself the hero of my own story, so much so that I would often have vivid dreams of action sequences; slaying a towering stone giant as lava erupted around us, harnessing deep powers of the mind to levitate and perform telekinesis, etc. \n Perhaps that is why I was attracted to programming in high school. Reading  source code  came easy to me. I wanted to be a game programmer because I could always "see" the source code in games I played-- the mechanics that goverend the physics of the virtual world. I remember doing exceptionally well in high school when I was introduced to  DarkBASIC  in my first programming class, where creating a cube was as simple as: \n make object cube  1 , 10 \n color  object  1 , rgb ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) \n \n Like magic, a cube appears. It\'s no coincidence that I got The Magician from this tarot deck tattooed on my forearm. \n If I am complex system operating on pure inspiration, then my source code would be The True Black Tarot. This was the thought that had inspired me to say "The Source" in my half-lucid state, not fully awake but not dreaming. \n As I began to write, I drew a single card from my tarot deck to reflect upon. \n The 3 of wands. \n Opening up the guidebook that accompanied it, this is what I read. \n \n EXPLORING TRAVEL \n LEADING ADVENTURE \n Where the Two of Wands represented a conflict between two choices: leaving or staying, the familiar or the new, the Three of Wands is already dead-set on embarking on a new adventure. In this card, the adventurer, is not only going somewhere new, but they are also taking their followers along. \n The Three of Wands is a card of leadership, finding new horizons, and forging the way for others. A marine bird is shown diving headfirst into the waves as others follow suit. From a great height, it was able to gain perspective and establish a strategic, forward-thinking view of the situation. \n Now, it is able to execute on a well-informed and planned strategy. With this card comes the optimism and excitement of success. \n \n How fitting, considering I just started my new blog and my  New Year\'s Resolution  to develop a working prototype of my game,  Space Pirates . \n \n \n'},{title:"The Future, and More Specifically, Details Involved with My Future.",frontmatter:{title:"The Future, and More Specifically, Details Involved with My Future.",description:"Lots of eye-rolling in this one.",date:"2011-03-06T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Goals","Memories"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"The Future, and More Specifically, Details Involved with My Future."},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Lots of eye-rolling in this one."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/The-Future-and-More-Specifically-Details-Involved-with-My-Future.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"The Future, and More Specifically, Details Involved with My Future."},{property:"og:description",content:"Lots of eye-rolling in this one."},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2011/3/The-Future-and-More-Specifically-Details-Involved-with-My-Future.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2011-03-06T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Goals"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"The Future, and More Specifically, Details Involved with My Future."},{itemprop:"description",content:"Lots of eye-rolling in this one."}]},regularPath:"/blog/2011/3/The-Future-and-More-Specifically-Details-Involved-with-My-Future.html",relativePath:"blog/2011/3/The-Future-and-More-Specifically-Details-Involved-with-My-Future.md",key:"v-0f344002",path:"/blog/2011/3/The-Future-and-More-Specifically-Details-Involved-with-My-Future.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  nakedlogic.blogspot.com .

After going to the Sziget Festival when he was 18, NTO started to hang out regularly at La Villa Rouge, and Bar Live, two legendary clubs in the South of France. At the time, German miinimal techno music was booming and Anthony Favier would spend his nights listening to Stephan Bodzin, James Holden, or the very beginnings of Paul Kalkbrenner.\nThe story behind NTO is also about his friendship with Worakls and Joachim Paster, with whom he created Hungry Music in 2013. Performing together on the Olympia's stage to the Vieilles Charrues Festival, they learned to master the stage.

If I ever visit Japan (and I intend to one day!), I should remember proper  chopstick dining etiquette . \n But I was eating ramen way before I even cared about Japan. Growing up in the household of a Mexican family, I lived on ramen as a staple meal. Specifically,  Maruchan® 's  Instant Lunch , which I'd often have for dinner loaded with whatever hot sauces were available; usually  Valentina  or  Tapatío . It wasn't until later in life that I was introduced to the ultimate hot sauce,  Blair's Mega Death . \n \n As a broke college student, I survived off of ramen as well. In addition to being so active all the time (skating around campus and doing yoga classes), I actually ended up losing a lot of weight. I joked that it was because of my \"ramen diet\". Which is funny, because I was only half joking. \n Now that I am an adult with the  luxury  of time and money, I've upgraded my ramen game, considerably. \n I've enjoyed many hours watching popular  animes  like Naruto and  Dragon Ball . I've always liked the food scene's where Naruto is dining at  Ichiraku's  famous ramen shop or Goku is  stuffing his face . \n \n Perhaps this helped establish ramen as the iconic food in Japan that it is. Either way, I started looking into videos on YouTube for what real ramen looked like. This (and Naruto) is where I got the inspiration to simply add pork loin,  Nori , a soft boiled egg and some vegetables to the mix. I realized you could also replace the pork loins with sushi if you'd like. \n Recipe \n 1 serving. 20-30 mins. prep time. \n Ingredients \n 1           pork loin\n1            Maruchan® Gold  packet\n500   mL    water\n1           soft boiled egg\n1/2   sheet Nori\n1/2         sliced jalapeños\n2     tbsp  chopped green onions\n2     tbsp  grilled white mushrooms or chopped carrots\n0.021 tbsp  pepper*\n \n *  Precise measurements are  important . \n Instructions \n \n Begin boiling water  for your soft boiled egg. Boil the egg for  7  mins. If you're smart and prepare the eggs ahead of time, you can also marinate the eggs in soy sauce for added flavor. \n Microwave noodles and water  in a bowl for  4  minutes. \n Slice pork loin in half, lengthwise.  I find the thinly sliced pork loin easier to bite out of. \n Grill pork loins in a frying pan.  Also grill mushrooms if you are including them as your preferred vegetable. \n Chop the rest of your vegetables.  You can do this while you are grilling the steak. \n Cut your Nori into two squares. \n Combine ingredients.  By now, your ramen should be done microwaving and your soft boiled egg should be almost done. Mix the ramen packet's sauce into the bowl, stir, and add vegetables. Garnish with pepper. Adorn steaks and Nori to the side of the bowl. \n Remove boiled egg from water.  I usually use tongs for this. Place into a cold bowl of water for a minute. Carefully crack the shell and peel. Slice the egg in half. Place in ramen. \n Eat it. \n \n \n \n \n"},{title:"Devil Like Me - Rainbow Kitten Surprise",frontmatter:{title:"Devil Like Me - Rainbow Kitten Surprise",date:"2021-01-25T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A case study on Devil Like Me by Rainbow Kitten Surprise.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Case Study","Music"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/seven%20+%20mary.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Devil Like Me - Rainbow Kitten Surprise"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A case study on Devil Like Me by Rainbow Kitten Surprise."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/seven%20+%20mary.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/25/Devil-Like-Me-Rainbow-Kitten-Surprise.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Devil Like Me - Rainbow Kitten Surprise"},{property:"og:description",content:"A case study on Devil Like Me by Rainbow Kitten Surprise."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/seven%20+%20mary.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/25/Devil-Like-Me-Rainbow-Kitten-Surprise.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-25T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Case Study"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Music"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Devil Like Me - Rainbow Kitten Surprise"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A case study on Devil Like Me by Rainbow Kitten Surprise."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/seven%20+%20mary.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/25/Devil-Like-Me-Rainbow-Kitten-Surprise.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/25/Devil-Like-Me-Rainbow-Kitten-Surprise.md",key:"v-c7cb164a",path:"/blog/2021/1/25/Devil-Like-Me-Rainbow-Kitten-Surprise.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Release",slug:"release"},{level:2,title:"Discovery",slug:"discovery"},{level:2,title:"Lyrics",slug:"lyrics"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n   \n \n I'm not actually a big fan of the music video, but I feel it's important to include. \n Release \n Devil Like Me  was released by Rainbow Kitten Surprise on November 19, 2013 as part of their  Seven + Mary  album. \n \n I haven't actually listened to the entire album, but I do like the album art. Rainbows are definitely an aesthetic while tripping, which I most certainly was when I really connected with this song. The melting \"Seven\" in the shape of a 7 also is reminiscent of the way his vocals sway between falsetto and head voice. \n I also really like the white-on-black text of the title. There's something about it that (for me, at least) evokes the imagery of the  Virgin Mary  with seven children. Perhaps it's because the only context I have for this album is this song that I equate Mary to the \"devil's\" lover. \n Discovery \n Although I don't remember how exactly I discovered this song on Spotify, I added it to my library early 2018 and to my  Faking Bright  playlist shortly after that. \n \n This playlist has been a favorite of mine and I've played it over many times, although usually Cautious Clay's  Cold War  is the standout song for me. \n It wasn't until years  later  that I was listening to this song again that it really struck a chord with me. Maybe I wasn't receptive to the lyrics until then, although I've always like the syrupy vocals. \n I texted this song to my dad (who is very religious) because it kind of reminded me of him, in the same way that I identify with the pain and sensitivity that the narrator portrays in this song. \n  Lyrics \n Devil Like Me ― Rainbow Kitten Surprise – Devil Like Me \n \n My heart and soul were never mine to own \n What you care to die for? What you care to die for? \n \n Unlike most religious people, I never found much comfort in the idea of an afterlife. Not only because of how ridiculous the notion seems to me, but because it doesn't seem to follow the way nature seems to work. \n One of my best friends gave me the book  365 Tao: Daily Meditations  as an adult and it has since had a profound effect on my life. It resonated with me because it confirmed much of the wisdom I saw myself in the patterns of nature. Death is one of those natural patterns. Life continues on, but individuals do not. Their actions may, however, have  lasting impressions  which ripple throughout time, but I learned it's very hard for things to have any kind of  significant  lifespan with respect to  time . \n Instead, I find comfort in the fact that we are a  part  of Life. That we are a  significant  part of a  whole . Therefore, I don't think this life is something one can truly own, since it's not something we get to \"keep\". Indeed, \"it was never mine to own\". \n The best we can do is decide what we stand for, and what we'd die for. \n \n Miss me when you, you wish you weren't right \n \n This surprisingly dense line begins to provide context for the song. I believe it plays on the question: \n Is it better to be right, or happy? \n This seems to be hinting at the aftermath of a breakup. One in which the narrator (the \"devil\") seems to believe that his former lover chose to be right, rather than happy; as if she chose to \"win\" the argument. Thus, she misses him when she wishes she wasn't right. \n \n Shake me all out if I'm wrong, for you, for you \n Shake it all out when I'm gone, I, for you \n \n In this painful imagery, the idea of having been with the narrator is now so repulsive to her that she has to physically shake herself off, like dust from a rug, to remove any trace of him. \n It reminds me of Kanye's comments about his ex (and how she felt bullied by them) when he claimed he needed to take  \"30 showers\"  after his breakup. \n How similar, then, must the \"devil\" feel? Indeed, when considering the devil or demons and the stain they must leave on the soul, how would you rid yourself of one other than by  exorcism ? \n How do you exorcise the devil himself? \n \n Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep, while the earth turns \n \n Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep? While the rest of the world moves on without him? And why does he cry? Surely because he feels some kind of remorse, sadness, or even scorn. \n \n   \n   Closeup of  L'Ange Dechu/ The Fallen Angel  by Alexandre Cabanel, Oil on canvas \n \n This is enough for me to warrant my sympathy. \n \n And his kids learn to say, \"fuck you\", they don't, love you \n \n I texted my dad this song because it reminded me of him. He get's a lot of flak from his kids and he's under the impression they hate him, which I don't think is entirely true. Behind all his faults and flaws, I think he's just as sensitive and misunderstood as the \"devil\" in this song. \n \n Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams \n Where the earth burns? \n She cries cause she's nothing like you, is she like you? \n \n Once again, the narrator humanizes this \"villain\" by showing that he, too, has fears, especially if anything bad were to happen to his loved one. That's something I think we all can relate to. \n He's scared for her because he see's  the world is burning  and she is the only good thing left in it. Naturally, he fears for her. \n She cries too, because she knows she's not like the rest of the world. Indeed,  she  is unlike anything else in this world. \n \n You see the devil don't mean to be evil \n He just regrettably forgets to exceed expectations \n \n \n \n"},{title:"The Origins of Space Pirates",frontmatter:{title:"The Origins of Space Pirates",date:"2021-01-03T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Some context to the development of Space Pirates.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Memories","Space Pirates","Inspiration"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/248743_10150184647159856_7618239_n_10150184647159856.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"The Origins of Space Pirates"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Some context to the development of Space Pirates."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/248743_10150184647159856_7618239_n_10150184647159856.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/3/The_Origins_of_Space_Pirates.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"The Origins of Space Pirates"},{property:"og:description",content:"Some context to the development of Space Pirates."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/248743_10150184647159856_7618239_n_10150184647159856.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/3/The_Origins_of_Space_Pirates.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-03T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Inspiration"},{itemprop:"name",content:"The Origins of Space Pirates"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Some context to the development of Space Pirates."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/248743_10150184647159856_7618239_n_10150184647159856.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/3/The_Origins_of_Space_Pirates.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/3/The_Origins_of_Space_Pirates.md",key:"v-4807ecbe",path:"/blog/2021/1/3/The_Origins_of_Space_Pirates.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Space Pirate",slug:"space-pirate"},{level:3,title:"Story",slug:"story"},{level:3,title:"Gameplay",slug:"gameplay"},{level:2,title:"Chosen Space",slug:"chosen-space"},{level:3,title:"Community",slug:"community"},{level:3,title:"Resources",slug:"resources"},{level:2,title:"Space Pirates",slug:"space-pirates"},{level:3,title:"Future Development",slug:"future-development"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" The Origins of Space Pirates \n \n I grew up in the 90s. This meant most of my fond childhood memories were created patiently staring into old computers. You know the kind; those old beige tower PCs. It seems like my dad always had at least two or three lying around, with only one of them ever working. \n The internet was a different place back then. Back then, there were more search engines being used than just Google, like Ask Jeeves and Dogpile. Dial-up speeds were slow and so this limited my computer use to learning how to code HTML in notepad and playing any games I could find online that would run on the family PC. Mostly  addictinggames.com ,  Flash  and Shockwave games.  Blades of Exile  was one game I could actually run so I spent a lot of time playing it, developing fond memories. \n Then I stumbled on a deceptively simple, browser-based game that captured my imagination... \n Space Pirate \n \n SpacePirate.com  was a browser-based space trading & combat MMORPG created in 1995. It was created using Shockwave and at the time, it was one of the best examples of how complex a game you could create using the technology. Version 2 of it included multiplayer chat which was a big deal at the time. \n At one point, I vaguely remember accessing some beta part of the website and chatting with who I think was the developer at the time. I remember asking something along the lines of how many planets in the game there were: something like thousands. As a kid, I didn't fully understand the power of computers still and my mind was blown away at this seemingly large number. I was star-struck at the promise of endless space-fairing adventure this game seemed to offer. \n Eventually, the game was scooped up by another company. They ran with it for a few more years with a couple updates before shutting it down, most likely after the 2001 dot-com bubble burst. \n Thus, Space Pirate faded from memory and grew deeply nestled in nostalgia. As I grew older and started learning about game development myself, I realized I wanted nothing more than to play this game again, even if it meant I had to re-create it myself. \n With it being so nestled in nostalgia and very little left in memory, I had to really search the archives of the internet to gather what information I could of it. Apparently  I wasn't the only one  on the same quest. \n Luckily, the  wayback machine  offered a glimpse into the past where I found the remains of my beloved game. I  emailed  the creator of the game to see if he could shed some light on the history of Space Pirate for my research and fortunately he responded. He even had similar inquiries, which prompted him to make a  mobile version  of the game for iOS. \n Story \n The premise of the game was as follows: \n SPACE PIRATE: THE BEGINNING \n It is so far in the future that no one even knows where \"Earth\" is anymore. The galaxy is pretty much controlled by the Galactic Empire, a large bureaucratic government ruling over most of the planets toward the center of the galaxy. At the ends of the galaxy are collections of \"independent\" planets that have their own governments. \n The real force between the stars is the dreaded Intergalactic Revenue Service (IRS). This is the organization that collects trade tariffs throughout the galaxy. Although the taxes go to the Empire, they collect taxes on \"independent\" planets as well. Only the few planets that are part of the rebellion do not pay taxes. Because of the IRS, a law-abiding trader can barely get by. Therefore, Imperial freighters, exempt from tariffs, have a virtual monopoly on trade. This is, of course, except for the Space Pirates. \n Space Pirates trade without paying taxes. They ignore the IRS agents at every space port and risk the wrath of IRS \"Tax Collector\" warships. \n The rewards of being a Space Pirate are many: fame, fortune and freedom. However, the risks are high as the Empire and the IRS consider tax evaders to be \"scum\" and not worth dealing with. Therefore, the IRS warships are under orders to attack and destroy pirates immediately upon contact. \n As a Space Pirate, you will have to keep up a ship and crew. Ships need fuel and repair, and your crew needs paychecks. Let your crew's morale fall too low and you could be looking at a mutiny. \n Space Pirates also get to do fun things like raid other ships and plunder the natural resources of uninhabited planets. There's also drinking and merriment to be had at every spaceport bar from one end of the galaxy to the other. \n \n There was also some more lore to the storyline, which can be found  here . \n Gameplay \n The general  mechanics  of the game were simple. You are a space pirate. You travel between planets going on missions, trading goods, plundering, avoiding the evil empire and most importantly, building your crew and ship. \n All I remember of my playthroughs of the game were the ambient sounds of the bar as I looked to hire crew members. You could buy a round of drinks for everyone, presumeably to make characters more agreeable to joining your crew. \n I always remember being suprised at how quickly my crew would mutiny due to not paying them enough. This was how I met the Game Over screen most of the times. Despite this, it remains one of my favorite aspects of the game. It was enough at the time for my imagination to give these crew members (who were really just stats on my ship) the personalities I would expect of a rebellious crew of space pirates. \n This was the charm of the game. It's simplistic and static layout left much of the adventure and fun of the game up to your imagination. \n However, the nostalgia goggles didn't help much in the way of remembering much of details of the mechanics of the game. Seeing as I wanted to recreate this game, I needed to dig deeper to sink my teeth on something more concrete to base my game mechanics off of. \n So I came across  this beginner's guide , which provided a deeper level of insight into the mechanics of the game. \n Spurred by bouts of nostalgia over time, I continued my research, digging a little deeper each time and accumulating more and more data about the game I knew I would recreate one day. \n Then one day I stumbled on the closest thing I could find to a working version of the game. \n Chosen Space \n \n Surprisingly, there were very few games similar to Space Pirates; a browser-based space trading MMORPG. The closest thing to Space Pirates out there was  EVE Online , which was a 3D version of the game but contained many of the same elements that made Space Pirates enjoyable, namely a sandbox environment with a free market economy. \n This is probably how I stumbled upon a game called  Chosen Space  during my research. \n It was beautiful. It was almost exactly the same game as Space Pirate, only more fully featured. It allowed you to build components for ships, take up bounties on other players and even play intergalactic politics by ruling over planets. As a ruler, you could impose your own taxes, form allegiances and post your own bounties. Being a bounty hunter was cool as well because you could actually track down players based on lingering  ion trails  their jumps would leave behind. Hunting became more of a sport as ships could equip scramblers to leave behind false trails to throw trackers off. \n Overall, Chosen Space seemed to improve upon one key aspect that Space Pirates never really capitalized on. Something that created loyal fans, dynamic gameplay, and a rich history. \n Community \n Because the game naturally fosters strong community relationships through gameplay, the forums were active and there were many great contributions to the wiki. Players were encouraged to create  biographies  for their characters, and there was even a forum dedicated to  roleplaying  your character! \n It reminded me of when  I  used to participate in a Star Wars roleplaying forum called  The Vast Empire . \n Like myself, I found others who went on nostalgic spirit quests to find their long lost game. Some of these pilgrims even formed small  communities . Still  others  who stumbled on Chosen Space stayed  because  of the community. \n Eventually, just like Space Pirate, Chosen Space was shut down. And just like Space Pirate, the creater went on to create a newer version of the game. Unfortunately, it seems to have fizzled out after the  Kickstarter  phase. \n Now these games exist as fond memories, leaving behind only artifacts of their existence. \n Resources \n The Chosen Space wiki pages provide a holistic picture of how the game worked and will be very valuable in creating the mechanics for a new Space Pirates game. \n \n Main Page V1 Wiki \n Main Page V2 Wiki \n Tutorials \n Interface \n \n Additionally, I found some ancient gameplay footage: \n Space Pirates \n At long last, it is finally time to create  Space Pirates , the spiritual successor to Space Pirate. \n You can see  here ,  here  and  here  my many past attempts to recreate my dream game. \n I've switched between staying true to the original and creating a browser game powered by modern technology or going the longer route and developing a custom 3D game engine in the style of  Dark Forces II . \n \n I even started to reach out to an  artist  to begin collaborating on the game, but unfortunately I think I did so a little too early in the development process. I credit him with introducing me to the  BLAME!  manga and  Devil Daggers , both of which I find inspiring as an art style. \n \n Most likely, tho, Space Pirates will be a browser based game; similar to Space Pirate and Chosen Space, but built on a modern web stack. I want the game to be freely available on the web using technology that won't be obsolete in a decade. Hopefully one day, this game can inspire others like  I've been inspired . \n Future Development \n Now that I feel I've collected sufficient information to begin outlining the game design, I hope to make significant progress on this project in 2021. I've graduated college, started a new job and have finally settled in after moving. Especially now that I'm working from home during quarantine, I should have plenty of time to dedicate to hard development. \n Moving forward, I'm going to consolidate all the work I've done so far into the  Hacker Club's   repo . I'll continue to post development blogs under the  Space Pirates  tag and soon I'll make another post outlining my plans for the game in more technical detail. \n If you're interested in following development of Space Pirates, you can follow me on  Twitter  or check my blog for updates. I also created  The Hacker Club  as a Discord community to follow my development streams on  Twitch . \n As development begins, I'm hoping to corner the  #spacepirates  hashtag to foster a community for all my fellow nostalgia pilgrims. \n \n \n"},{title:"Untitled",frontmatter:{title:"Untitled",description:"Recounting my search for internships.",date:"2012-02-09T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Memories"],meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"Untitled"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Recounting my search for internships."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2012/2/9/Untitled.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Untitled"},{property:"og:description",content:"Recounting my search for internships."},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2012/2/9/Untitled.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2012-02-09T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Untitled"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Recounting my search for internships."}]},regularPath:"/blog/2012/2/9/Untitled.html",relativePath:"blog/2012/2/9/Untitled.md",key:"v-3202095b",path:"/blog/2012/2/9/Untitled.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" Note:  This article was imported from my old blog,  christoferpadilla.tumblr.com . \n Woo! So much stuff has happened since I last bothered to mention it. I've definitely been working on The Zombie Game with Kevin a lot more now and I'm happy to say that were almost done with it now! Note, I use the word \"done\" in the loosest term possible. \n Any way, last week there was a Career Expo and a Coop/Internship Fair. Naturally I went to both because I was looking to get an internship. (See  here ) And guess what? I actually heard back from someone? First I gave my resume to AMD at the Career Expo, then I went to this local company, DiSTI, because I saw that they had a few products out that dealt a lot with graphics, which I found pretty interesting. \n I heard back from DiSTI first, and they wanted an interview which we had on Tuesday. It definitely went a lot smoother than I expected and I got a call back from them today saying that they're ready to move on to the next step of the process, which is just a background check, before they can make me an offer. This is pretty exciting since they are looking for someone to stay with them pretty long term. And I'd get to work during semesters. The thing is they're looking for about 20 hours a week, which kinda scares me a little, but still, pay is good. \n Next, I heard from AMD. AMD! I was pretty excited. But then I heard that the position would be in Austin, Texas for the summer AND fall. I'd be getting school credit for it, though, since it'd count as a coop. Plus the pay is a little better, however, I'd need to pay for my own housing and food while out there. \n And on top of all that, I still haven't heard back from Google about the Freshman Engineering Practicum. I should get a response from them sometime this week, though. This will definitely be a tough decision to make. \n In other news, there's a new club that started up at UCF called te Mobile Makers. I'm pretty excited for it since it's basically a community for UCF developers, albeit for mobile/cloud development. \n This will be an exciting semester. \n \n \n"},{title:"Henry",frontmatter:{title:"Henry",date:"2021-01-23T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A guide to becoming a responsible jumping spider pet owner.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Pets","Guides"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/henry.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Henry"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A guide to becoming a responsible jumping spider pet owner."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/henry.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/23/Henry.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Henry"},{property:"og:description",content:"A guide to becoming a responsible jumping spider pet owner."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/henry.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/23/Henry.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-23T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Pets"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Guides"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Henry"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A guide to becoming a responsible jumping spider pet owner."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/henry.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/23/Henry.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/23/Henry.md",key:"v-97e11312",path:"/blog/2021/1/23/Henry.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Background",slug:"background"},{level:2,title:"Research",slug:"research"},{level:2,title:"Habitat",slug:"habitat"},{level:2,title:"Feeding Time",slug:"feeding-time"},{level:2,title:"Environment",slug:"environment"},{level:2,title:"Conclusion",slug:"conclusion"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n Say hello to Henry! \n Henry is a  Phidippus regius , more commonly referred to as a regal jumping spider. I named him after a certain  King Henry V . \n I did a lot of  research  before acquiring him to ensure that I would be a good pet owner for him. I've collected most of that research here as a guide in case you're interested in becoming one, too. \n After about a month of research, I bought him off of eBay. It was actually pretty hard to find a seller that I could buy one from. There were plenty of Facebook groups for owners, but the few sites I found where you could buy jumping spiders from had  this  particular species I was after, out of stock. \n \n I was very excited when he arrived.

I thought this was interesting since it wasn't particularly dewy nor had it rained recently and we weren't next to any kind of body of water. \n Upon closer inspection, I realized that each of those raindrops, like tiny glistening rainbows of light, were in fact,  spiders . \n Scary. \n This was the first time in recent memory that I'd encountered something in this world that I genuinely feared. It has long been my belief that fear, apart from a reflexive survival instinct, generally stems from a misunderstanding of the unknown. \n And so, with the intent at better understanding this unknown and thus conquering my fears, I began my research into spiders. \n Research \n First, I began my research into what kind of spider it was that I might have encountered in the woods of South Carolina during the winter. I couldn't find exactly what kind of spiders they were (in Florida it probably would have been something like a  wolf  spider), so I instead began going down a different avenue of research: how  intelligent  are spiders? Indeed, this was at the source, my fear of spiders. \n Seeing that many reflective little rainbows that night, like a sea of stars in the  dark forest , instilled fear in me because it was more like a sea of tiny  intelligent  minds gazing back at me. Nature's  automata . \n So I started going down a rabbit hole of interesting YouTube videos on the intelligence of spiders, where I invariably came across  the jumping spider . \n \n   \n \n I found many other interesting videos on the subject, such as the  largest jumping spider in the world , a look  inside a jumping spider's brain , and  how to train a jumping spider . \n Habitat \n I eventually came across  this  video on how to care for a jumping spider as a pet. It was very cute and I decided right then and there that I wanted to own a one as a pet, too. \n Surprisingly, I couldn't find very many terrariums fit for a jumping spider. According to my  research , jumping spiders are  arboreal , which means they will appreciate an enclosure that is tall. This is because they will usually build a sac on the very top of the enclosure, which is why it's a good idea to have one with a side door. \n Thankfully,  Snake Discovery  provided a link to a great enclosure that they used in the video. This was the  Zilla Habitat , which I found readily available at my local Petco. \n I picked up a few other items to complete the terrarium, like some  soil , moss and a few other decorations, as well as a  temperature and humidity gauge  which I put on velcro on the outside of the enclosure to make sure his environment is comfortable. \n \n   \n   Waiting for my new roommate to arrive. \n \n The next morning, I found that lil Henry had, indeed, built his sac at the very top of the enclosure! Cool! \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n As I moved him around the apartment to get some sunshine, I found he built another sac on the wooden decoration in the enclosure. The wooden piece fit snugly inside and the soil packed around it probably dampened some of the vibrations of the case as I moved it. \n Feeding Time \n It took about a week after I ordered Henry online for him to arrive, so I couldn't know for how long it'd been since he'd last eaten since being packaged. It's  generally recommended  that you feed them every 2-3 days. \n I ran back to Petco to try and find some bugs for Henry to eat and I couldn't find any live food; All the jars I examined showed nothing but dead bugs. \n Luckily, there was a PetSmart nearby. There, they did have a nice section for live feed and they even had an employee stationed there. I picked up some  crickets . \n I tried to feed one to Henry the first day, but he didn't seem interested in it for whatever reason. I took the cricket out of his enclosure since  you're not supposed to leave live crickets in there overnight . I put the cricket back into a big Tupperware® container that I had poked holes into, with the rest of his doomed family. \n The next day, I put another cricket back in his cage and left him. I went about my business and kind of forgot about him until I checked his case again later and noticed not only had he emerged from his sac he had hidden himself away in, but he also had caught the cricket! \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n Man was he going to town on that bug. \n Environment \n I kept him on the  TV  to get some sunshine throughout the day, moving him into some shade if his enclosure got too hot. You aren't supposed to put them in direct sunlight. I found  this  great guide on creating the ideal conditions for your pet jumping spider to be comfortable in. \n As I walked by him later, I saw him coming out of his hiding place once again to explore some more of his environment. \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n (This was while I was rediscovering my absolute BANGER of a playlist I'd made on Spotify back in 2018.) \n \n I'm glad he was (literally) warming up to his new home. \n As the thermometer indicated his enclosure was getting hotter, I moved him into the corner of the window to provide some shade. I also misted the side of his cage to provide him with some water droplets to drink if he wanted. I read somewhere that a good time to do so is when you feed them. \n I tossed in the humidity gauge as well because it looked like it was getting too arid for him (at least on the outside of the cage). The moss in the enclosure helps to retain the humidity. \n \n It's also important to keep him warm. Sadly, no  mittens  for him. \n Conclusion \n This marks the beginning of my journey as a pet owner of a  Phidippus regius . Henry, king of the spiders! \n Hopefully this guide will help you on your quest to becoming a jumping spider pet owner as well. \n And if not, thanks for joining me on my journey!

Carlos had come over to my place on Thursday to hangout for the weekend. Mom had just been Baker Acted and was in the hospital so between that and work, he'd been under a lot of stress lately. He called off work for the next few days and drove 2 hours over the state line to visit. \n Things had been going well so far. I slept in till around 10 because it's the weekend and then I made us a nice breakfast of bacon, chorizo, eggs and toast. I had cottage cheese with my meal as well because cottage cheese rocks. \n Carlos thought he heard a knock at the door but I dismissed it, joking that I never get visitors. \n I realized though, that I  had  ordered a few items recently which I had  budgeted  under Home Improvement. But I had just checked on the Amazon app and it looked like my stuff wasn't supposed to be delivered until Tuesday. \n I opened the door and BOOM! Three packages! Sitting at my doorstep. I was very excited. \n I opened the first and largest one of them: a  hammock holder ! This was awesome because rather than buy another piece of furniture for my apartment, I could simply use my  beloved  hammock. \n \n \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n                 \n                     \n                     \n                 \n             \n             \n             \n                 \n                     \n                         \n                             \n                             \n                         \n                     \n                 \n             \n             \n                  View this post on Instagram \n             \n             \n             \n                 \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                 \n                 \n                     \n                     \n                 \n                 \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                 \n             \n             \n                 \n                 \n             \n         \n         \n             A post shared by Christofer Padilla (@rockzombie2) \n         \n     \n \n \n \n The second package I got was a  little red wagon ! \n I'd seen a lot of my neighbors around the apartment complex carting around their garbage bags to the dumpster. I stopped and talked with a few of them, always inquiring as to where I could find one. Walmart didn't carry any, so I looked on Amazon for one and found something simple I liked. \n Finally, and to my great surprise, my packages from Google arrived! Incredible! I was so surprised since I had placed my order only a few days ago and did not expect them to arrive so soon; I'm always pleased with my purchases from Google. \n This time, I bought a  Google TV . Really it's just a chromecast device, but I bought it  for  the Google TV features. I've been using my  Nest Mini  devices around my home often to do things like play music and turn on my smart TV, but I wanted my voice commands to better  interface  with my different streaming apps. \n I also bought another Nest Mini device to place in my bathroom so I could play music to sing in the shower with. \n Overall, my day was going pretty swimmingly. \n Carlos and I realized around 12:30 PM that we were scheduled to get on a video call with some of the rest of our family to discuss our budget for Mom. \n This was when my day started to turn south. \n Suffice it to say, I was gravely offended by one of my other brothers, which put me in a foul mood for the rest of the afternoon. \n With my new wagon, we loaded the garbage and made the short trip over to the dumpster before we ran errands. \n By this point, I was still seething and not very  present . I tossed the first bag in with my left hand, swinging it by the top. Distracted, I tossed the second bag in, heaving it with the assistance of my right hand. \n \"FUCK!\" \n I felt a searing pain in my right thumb as I looked down and clutched it with my other hand. \n It looked bad. \n A line of blood traced the side of my thumb and beads of deep red blood rolled out of the gash. I could see on my thumbnail where  whatever  piece of garbage that had cut me skidded off my nail, leaving a shallow groove behind. \n We went back inside and patched it up as best we could, using gauze and tape to keep pressure on the wound. There was a lot of blood. \n Carlos suggested that we go to an emergency room because the cut might be deep enough to warrant stitches. I hoped not because if so, this would be my first time getting them. \n At the ER, I waited about an hour before a staff member came to look at the laceration, as they put it. It would indeed require a few stitches. \n Since I didn't know when the last time I got a  Tetanus  shot was, they gave me one to ward off infections. Good for ten years, apparently. \n Another hour, and I was out of there. Three stitches and a gauzed up, numbed up thumb to show for it. \n \n I'm glad I set up the hammock stand before the accident as my right thumb is now practically unusuable. Even typing with it now, holding it steady while I use my left thumb on the space bar, hurts if I bend it in the wrong direction or accidentally forget and smack it against the spacebar. \n A shame, really, since I'm in the business of typing. \n It doesn't help at all either that I was recently diagnosed with  De Quervain's tenosynovitis , which makes moving my left wrist and/or thumb painful as well. \n \n Update:  I went back to the orthopedic clinic and got a shot in the wrist which helped reduce the swelling. My wrist is fine now and while I was there I also got copies of the x-rays they took when diagnosing my wrist pain.  Good bones .\n \n \n As Carlos put it, \"You're just not winning today, Chris!\" \n I spent the rest of the day relaxing. We checked out a local record store, and then went home. I made a mean Chilaquiles dish for dinner and then we watched  Bombshell  with the new Google TV setup. \n Today was alright, I guess. \n \n \n"},{title:"Analyzing Potential Blockchain Candidates",frontmatter:{title:"Analyzing Potential Blockchain Candidates",date:"2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Analyzing various blockchains as candidates to develop on.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Space Pirates","Blockchain","Analysis"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.png"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Analyzing Potential Blockchain Candidates"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Analyzing various blockchains as candidates to develop on."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.png"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/8/Analyzing_Potential_Blockchain_Candidates.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Analyzing Potential Blockchain Candidates"},{property:"og:description",content:"Analyzing various blockchains as candidates to develop on."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.png"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/8/Analyzing_Potential_Blockchain_Candidates.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Blockchain"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Analysis"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Analyzing Potential Blockchain Candidates"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Analyzing various blockchains as candidates to develop on."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.png"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/8/Analyzing_Potential_Blockchain_Candidates.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/8/Analyzing_Potential_Blockchain_Candidates.md",key:"v-326273b6",path:"/blog/2021/1/8/Analyzing_Potential_Blockchain_Candidates.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Properties of a dApp",slug:"properties-of-a-dapp"},{level:2,title:"Benefits of dApp Development",slug:"benefits-of-dapp-development"},{level:2,title:"Implications of dApp Development",slug:"implications-of-dapp-development"},{level:2,title:"Proof-of-work",slug:"proof-of-work"},{level:2,title:"Proof-of-Stake",slug:"proof-of-stake"},{level:2,title:"EOSIO",slug:"eosio"},{level:3,title:"Info",slug:"info"},{level:3,title:"Advantages",slug:"advantages"},{level:3,title:"Downsides",slug:"downsides"},{level:3,title:"Final Thoughts",slug:"final-thoughts"},{level:3,title:"Tutorials",slug:"tutorials"},{level:3,title:"References",slug:"references"},{level:2,title:"Ethereum",slug:"ethereum"},{level:3,title:"Info",slug:"info-2"},{level:3,title:"Advantages",slug:"advantages-2"},{level:3,title:"Downsides",slug:"downsides-2"},{level:3,title:"Sidechain",slug:"sidechain"},{level:3,title:"Tutorials",slug:"tutorials-2"},{level:3,title:"References",slug:"references-2"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" Analyzing Potential Blockchain Candidates \n \n So far, I've already created a  database diagram  of the  Space Pirates  game. The next step in the development of the game is to decide on a blockchain to use to launch Space Pirates as a dApp on. \n This is my analysis of the following blockchains I'm considering: \n \n EOSIO \n Ethereum \n NEO \n Tron \n WAX \n Stellar \n Tezos \n Custom Blockchain \n \n Contents   [ hide ] Analyzing Potential Blockchain Candidates Questions to Keep in Mind During Analysis Decentralized Applications Properties of a dApp Benefits of dApp Development Implications of dApp Development Concensus Algorithms Proof-of-work Proof-of-Stake Blockchains EOSIO Info Advantages Delegated Proof of Stake Scalability Operating Costs Flexibility Downsides Operating Costs Centralization Final Thoughts Tutorials References Ethereum Info Advantages Downsides Sidechain Tutorials References Conclusion \n Questions to Keep in Mind During Analysis \n Before we begin, here are some questions we want to keep in mind when evaluating a specific blockchain: \n \n What is the development status of a platform? \n What type of Blockchain do you require? \n What Languages does the platform support? \n How popular is the platform? \n What Blockchain Consensus Protocol does the platform use to achieve consensus? \n Does the platform support Smart Contracts Functionality? \n What kind of scalability does your solution need? \n \n These are all great questions we will answer in our analysis. \n Decentralized Applications \n First of all, a dApp is a decentralized application. According to  Ethereum's documentation , a dapp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, unlike a traditional app, whose backend code runs on centralized servers. \n A dapp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as  IPFS . \n Properties of a dApp \n dApps are: \n \n Decentralized  that makes them independent, and no one controls them. \n Deterministic  i.e., they perform the same function irrespective of the environment they are executed. \n Turing complete , which means given the required resources, the dapp can perform any action. \n Isolated , which means they are executed in a virtual environment so that if the smart contract happens to have a bug, it won’t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network. \n Benefits of dApp Development \n \n Zero downtime  – once the smart contract at the core of an app is deployed and on the blockchain, the network as a whole will always be able to serve clients looking to interact with the contract. Malicious actors therefore cannot launch denial-of-service attacks targeted towards individual dapps. \n Privacy  – you don’t need to provide real-world identity to deploy or interact with a dapp. \n Resistance to censorship  – no single entity on the network can block users from submitting transactions, deploying dapps, or reading data from the blockchain. \n Complete data integrity  – data stored on the blockchain is immutable and indisputable, thanks to cryptographic primitives. Malicious actors cannot forge transactions or other data that has already been made public. \n Trustless computation/verifiable behavior  – smart contracts can be analyzed and are guaranteed to execute in predictable ways, without the need to trust a central authority. This is not true in traditional models; for example, when we use online banking systems, we have to trust that financial institutions will not misuse our financial data, tamper with records, or get hacked. \n Implications of dApp Development \n \n Maintenance  – dapps can be harder to maintain because code and data published to the blockchain is harder to modify. It’s hard for developers to make updates to their dapps (or the underlying data stored by a dapp) once they are deployed - even if bugs or security risks are identified in an old version. \n Performance overhead  – there is a huge performance overhead, and scaling is really hard. To achieve the level of security, integrity, transparency, and reliability that Ethereum aspires to, every node runs and stores every transaction. On top of this, proof-of-work takes time as well. A back-of-the-envelope calculation puts the overhead at something like 1,000,000x that of standard computation currently. \n Network congestion  – at least in the current model (of Ethereum), if one dapp is using too many computational resources, the entire network gets backed up. Currently, the network is only able to process about 10 transactions per second; if transactions are being sent in faster than this, the pool of unconfirmed transactions can quickly balloon. \n User experience  – it may be harder to engineer user-friendly experiences: The average end user might find it too difficult to set up a tool stack necessary to interact with the blockchain in a truly secure fashion. \n Centralization  – User-friendly and developer-friendly solutions built on top of the base layer of a blockchain might end up looking like centralized services anyways: for example, such services may store keys or other sensitive information server-side, serve a frontend using a centralized server, or run important business logic on a centralized server before writing to the blockchain. This eliminates many (if not all) of the advantages of blockchain over the traditional model. \n Concensus Algorithms \n It's worth looking at some of the underlying concensus algorithms which govern a blockhain first, before we look at specific blockchains. This will help classify blockchains to an extent. \n The two best known concensus algorithms as well as the two most commonly used in the context of cryptocurrencies is Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). By understanding these algorithms, it may help us understand some of the nuances of blockchains that use another form of consensus. \n A concensus algorithm is necessary for a cryptocurrency to prevent the common flaw of digital currencies known as  double-spending . \n Proof-of-work \n Proof-of-work  (PoW) is a form of cryptographic  zero-knowledge  proof in which one party (the prover) proves to others (the verifiers) that a certain amount of computational effort has been expended for some purpose. It is the concensus algorithm popularized by Bitcoin. \n There are many great videos on YouTube that explain the Proof-of-Work algorithm well, but I found YouTuber  nang  to have one of the best explanations that visualizes the concept of zero-knowledge proof. \n \n Much like a student shows his answer on a math quiz is correct by showing his work, Proof-of-Work concensus  works  because the proof that blocks are valid comes from the computationally expensive work the CPUs do to solve hashes. \n In order for a block producer to double-spend, not only would they have to recompute the hashes for every other block broadcasted on the network, they would also have to outproduce every other node. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. \n The downside to this is the vast amount of computing resources that the PoW mechanism requires. This consumes a significant amount of electricity. Indeed, Bitcoin's energy consumption can  power an entire country . \n However, there is no alternative design known that could replace Proof-of-Work but keeps its desirable attributes such as: \n \n permissionless mining \n fair distribution of coins \n security against many known attacks \n bootstrappability of new nodes in a hostile environment \n graceful degradation and recovery even in the face of a successful attack or network failure \n unforgeable and statically verifiable costliness \n Proof-of-Stake \n What is  Proof-of-Stake ? \n \n With the advent of modern cryptography, the idea that information can be physically real — and valuable — has moved from the dingy halls of philosophy departments to the concrete world of business. We are all familiar with the economic activity enabled by secure communication: negotiations, contracts, transactions, sales and commands can be sent on the public Internet with no fear of forgery or interception. We are also familiar with the financial consequences when secret data is lost or stolen. \n Since the advent of cryptographic currency in January 2009 [3] this notion of valuable information has been made concrete. It is possible to hold and exchange a fungible store of value, using public communication media, with cryptographic rather than physical security preventing fraud or theft. Rather than saying “this encryption key is worth $10,000 because that’s what it will cost us if its encrypted data is exposed” one can say “this key is worth $10,000 but can be broken up, sending only $20 of it to another party while keeping the rest”. \n With this context, proof-of-stake is a simple idea. A proof of stake is a cryptographic proof of ownership. With cryptocurrencies, it is possible for a proof-of-stake to not only prove ownership of a precise amount of currency, but also prove that this currency satisfies some property (say, it is locked and unspendable until some contract is satisfied). \n In particular, proven stake in a scarce and experimental cryptocurrency can be considered a proof of vested interest in the project’s success. By proving stake which is time-locked, it can be used to prove interest in the project’s continued (and sustainable) existence. \n \n In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e., the stake). It depends on the specific blockchain implementation. Selection by account balance would result in (undesirable) centralization, as the single richest member would have a permanent advantage. Thus, several different methods of selection have been devised. \n In general, block producers (determined by whatever means) stake some amount of their coin as collatoral while they produce blocks. The idea is that should the get caught double-spending, they lose their staked coins. Theoretically, this should prevent (or at least discourage) nefarious block producers from double-spending because the amount of coins they stand to gain from doing so would be less than the amount they have staked. \n In Proof-of-Work blockchains, miners \"vote\" on valid transactions with their CPU power; the more of it you have, the larger influence your \"vote\" has. In a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, stakeholders vote with their money instead. \n Some people ( including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin )have found criticism of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm, even going so far as to say that concensus using such methods are  impossible . \n One issue that can arise is the \"nothing-at-stake\" problem, wherein block generators have nothing to lose by voting for multiple blockchain histories, thereby preventing consensus from being achieved. Because unlike in proof-of-work systems, there is little cost to working on several chains. \n There have been  some attempts  to fix these problems, however. \n To his credit, Vitalik points out the three main advantages of Proof-of-Stake as well: \n \n It does not waste any significant amount of electicity. Sure, there is a need for stakeholders to keep trying to produce blocks, but no one gains any benefit from making more than one attempt per account per second; hence, the electricity expenditure is comparable to any other non-wasteful internet protocol (eg. BitTorrent) \n It can arguably provide a much higher level of security. In proof of work, assuming a liquid market for computing power the cost of launching a 51% attack is equal to the cost of the computing power of the network over the course of two hours - an amount that, by standard economic principles, is roughly equal to the total sum of block rewards and transaction fees provided in two hours. In proof of stake, the threshold is theoretically much higher: 51% of the entire supply of the currency. \n Depending on the precise algorithm in question it can potentially allow for much faster blockchains (eg. NXT has one block every few seconds, compared to one per minute for Ethereum and one per ten minutes for Bitcoin) \n Blockchains \n EOSIO \n Info \n \n White-paper:  https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md \n Code:  https://github.com/EOSIO/eos \n Concensus Algorithm:  Delegated Proof of Stake \n Smart contract langauge:  C++ \n Documentation:  https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/overview/index \n \n Before we begin, we should clarify the difference between EOS and EOSIO. \n EOSIO software \n \n A free, open-source software that can deploy highly customizable blockchains on which developers and entrepreneurs can run high-performing blockchain applications. \n \n EOS blockchain \n \n A deployed blockchain powered by the EOSIO software. \n Advantages \n Delegated Proof of Stake \n Before getting into some of the other advantages of EOSIO, we should first examine the concensus algorithm and it's advantages. \n Natasha Prayag of  eToro  wrote a great article on the differences between  DPoS vs PoS . \n \n In order to truly determine who comes out on top in DPoS vs PoS: winner takes all, we first need to examine some of the advantages and disadvantages of each system. So, what are some of the advantages of the Proof of Stake System? \n \n Stakers receive coins as a reward for contributing to the network. \n Blockchain consensus is reached digitally. \n Users can contribute just by staking coins in their wallet. \n Users don’t need to build massive mining operations, rather they can earn rewards simply for holding and staking a coin. \n PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW \n \n Some advantages of the Delegated Proof of Stake system: \n \n DPoS allows for block producers to validate transactions in seconds – providing faster transactions than PoS and PoW. \n Delegates are elected through a democratic voting system, so each token holder has a say. \n Security: voters can immediately detect malice on the part of a delegate, and that delegate can then be voted out of the system. \n DPoS is even more energy efficient than PoS and uses less hardware. \n Block producers, or Delegates, can be voted out of the system at any point – so they’re forced to be on their best behavior. \n \n \n Very succinct. So as far as I'm concerned, the advantages of DPoS are: \n \n Fast(er than PoS and PoW) \n Secure \n \n Neat. But what about the advantages of building a dApp on EOSIO? \n Well here we have it,  straight from the horses mouth : \n \n It's scalable. \n It's fast. \n It's virtually free. \n It's green. \n \n So this might be a little biased, seeing as this was written by  block.one  (the company that created EOS) shortly after EOSIO's inception. \n Scalability \n One bold claim of there's was that EOSIO is the most used blockchain software in the world. Which actually still seems to be  true , at least according to daily activity. \n \n This is probably because not only is EOSIO fast, enabling it to process many transactions, but it's also scalable, which I'm sure is something a lot of dApp developers look for in a blockchain. \n EOSIO was designed for scale from the ground up and is the first to use WebAssembly, which has some of the fastest and highest execution speed. This means development is done in C++, which is a language I have familiarity with. So another advantage is that I don't have to learn a new language for programming smart contracts in. \n Operating Costs \n Another claim is that it's \"virtually free\". Notice the implied asterisk. The reason why it's \"virtually free\" is because, unlike other first-generation blockchains apps where the user has to pay a fee per transaction, the cost is relayed to the developer and is more akin to the cost of maintaining a server. The way this works is that the developer is allowed network resources ( RAM ,  CPU  and  NET ) proportional to the amount of EOS tokens they stake. \n Flexibility \n One of the most appealing aspects of EOSIO is that it is not just a blockchain, but a blockchain  software . This means I can customize just about every aspect of it. Indeed, it is much like a free and open-source operating system. \n In this case, the operating system is a collection of smart contracts. These system contracts are defined in the  eosio.contracts  library and encapsulate the base functionality for an EOSIO based blockchain. \n \n eosio.bios \n eosio.system \n eosio.msig \n eosio.token \n eosio.wrap \n Downsides \n First of all, I would like to credit  Jack Tanner  for providing an excellent write up on most of the issues I've found with EOSIO. Many of the following points I realized because of his article. \n Operating Costs \n With EOSIO being \"virtually free\", the one obvious downside is that the cost of running the dApp falls to me, the developer. I still see this as an advantage, however, since it makes the game free to play for the users. \n Another downside Jack pointed out is that the cost of RAM changes without altering the supply or demand of RAM. To elaborate, the price of RAM is set by a Bancor-like algorithm that has several inputs including the current supply of RAM and demand for RAM. It has no knowledge and does not consider the $ cost of EOS. While this is a fair point, currently, EOS is  pretty cheap  right now. Plus, because the price of RAM  is  calculated by supply and demand, it does seem like the price is set fairly in terms of EOS tokens. \n Centralization \n One other major concern with EOSIO has been fear that it may be too centralized. Most of the concerns outlined in  this  article are that on EOS, 21 nodes have all the power over the chain, with  most of them located in China . \n Once again,  Jack points out  that protocol upgrades only need 15 block producers to approve. This includes changes to the token, how contracts and accounts are managed, voting and election of BPs and more. When protocal upgrades are approved, nodes that have not upgraded their software will stop syncing. \n These centralization concerns are valid and could develop an unhealthy  meta-game  in the future. \n However, this means that upgrades to governance (soft forks) and protocols (hard forks) are not only possible, but are done in a transparent manner so detection of a malicious attack can be detected immediately. \n Final Thoughts \n EOSIO seems like a strong candidate for developing the Space Pirates game because of it's high transaction speed and ability to customize each component of the blockchain. \n The only thing I still haven't determined is if creating a new blockchain will be run on the EOS blockchain. If so, I'll have to share resources with every other dApp running on EOS main-net. If not, then does that mean that the network will start off with just one node (my own)? If that's the case, it might jeopardize the entire network if it's dependant on one node. \n How would I incentivize people to run their own nodes? And would that be too high of a barrier-to-entry just to play a game? \n These are things I haven't really found an answer to yet and will probably have to investigate further if I decide to use EOSIO. \n Tutorials \n \n https://battles.eos.io/ \n References \n \n Learnings from building my first dapp on EOS blockchain \n Crypto Dynasty White Paper 2.0 \n Ethereum \n Info \n \n White-paper:  https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/ \n Code:  https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum \n Concensus Algorithm: Currently,  Proof-of-Work , eventually  Proof of stake \n Smart contract language:  Solidity  and  Vyper  most common \n Documentation:  https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/ \n Advantages \n Despite the growth of alternative blockchain networks, decentralized applications (dApps) exist almost exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the primary driver of this trend because it allows developers to launch any dApp regardless of the underlying coding language while using Solidity for coding smart contracts. This network architecture eliminates the need to develop an entirely new blockchain for every dApp. \n One of the big advantages of the Ethereum blockchain is it benefits from the network effect. With a community of highly skilled developers, there are a lot of tool and crucial extension documentation to help other developers get started. The increasing number of developers utilizing these solutions has perpetuated the development of better tools, better code, better platforms, and ultimately, better dApps. \n On the Ethereum network, dApps can use a native token that adheres to the  ERC-20  in order to monetize assets in the dApp. The ERC-20 standard enables the frictionless exchange of these crypto assets. \n To interact with smart contract instances on the blockchain, we can utilize a javascript library called  web3 . \n With web3, we can submit four types of transactions: \n \n Send ethers from one  external account  to another  external account  (like a Bitcoin transaction) \n Send a “blank” transaction to  deploy a smart contract  (becomes a contract account) \n Send ethers from an  external account  to a  contract account \n Send a transaction to  execute a method  within the contract account (to update or retrieve the contract state, or call other contracts) \n \n Calls that simply retrieve data from the blockchain or contract are “instant” and free. We can return any values we want from these calls. \n Another nice benefit is that functions can emit  events  which web3 can  watch  for using the transaction hash. We can also throw exceptions to handle errors. A thrown exception will always revert the state. \n Downsides \n Ethereum is unable to access real time data from outside the blockchain. Developers need to rely on trusted third party data providers, called oracles, to provide smart contracts with outside information like weather, random numbers, or currency values. \n You are also tied to paying for your transactions by the operation with gas that translates into Ethereum’s ether. As a result, using the current version of Solidity, you could very feasibly find yourself hitting a transaction limit if the computation you intend to perform is too expensive (like verifying checkmate in a game of chess). As a result, on-chain computations because become costly in terms of money and network bandwidth. \n To elaborate, transactions and calls are executed by the EVM as opcodes, which equate to gas. Transactions that  update  the blockchain or contract state require  payment  of ethers. These will take  time . \n Tip:  Because nodes compete to mine the next block, function calls are executed redundantly across the network. To offset this waste of computing resources, a best practice is to perform as many calculations  off-chain  as possible. \n Ethereum also uses Solidity as it's most common smart-contract langauge. This means I would have to spend more time learning this langauge. \n Sidechain \n The Matic Network Sidechain offers a \"layer 2\" scalability solution for Ethereum, similar to Bitcoin's  Lightning network . \n \n Matic Network Sidechain \n \n https://medium.com/matic-network/what-is-matic-network-466a2c493ae1 \n Tutorials \n \n Ethereum Tutorials \n Remix, an online Ethereum editor \n References \n \n Are most dApps built on ETH? \n ERC-20 Standard \n A Complete Mental Model for Ethereum dApp Development \n Conclusion \n I originally was going to analyze a few other blockchain technologies, however, I've come to realize that progress on my project has suffered because of analysis paralysis. \n I've therefore decided to go with my gut originally indicated and chose EOSIO as the blockchain to build my game on. The reason for this is mostly because of it's high transactions per second and the fact that unlike Ethereum, you don't have to pay a fee for transactions. \n \n \n"},{title:"The Eternal War Machine",frontmatter:{title:"The Eternal War Machine",date:"2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Territory struggles as eternal state machines.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Memories","Space Pirates","Blockchain"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/warmachine.png"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"The Eternal War Machine"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Territory struggles as eternal state machines."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/warmachine.png"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/8/The_Eternal_War_Machine.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"The Eternal War Machine"},{property:"og:description",content:"Territory struggles as eternal state machines."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/warmachine.png"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/8/The_Eternal_War_Machine.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-08T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Blockchain"},{itemprop:"name",content:"The Eternal War Machine"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Territory struggles as eternal state machines."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/warmachine.png"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/8/The_Eternal_War_Machine.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/8/The_Eternal_War_Machine.md",key:"v-38e19ca5",path:"/blog/2021/1/8/The_Eternal_War_Machine.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"War as a State Machine",slug:"war-as-a-state-machine"},{level:3,title:"The Game of Life",slug:"the-game-of-life"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" The Eternal War Machine \n \n I left the house during my lunch break today to pick up a rug I had bought from a fellow employee across town. I would stop to pick up some bread on my way home, as well. \n I waved to my neighbor pulling in to the apartment complex as I walked to my car. He thanked me for returning his mail to him. He used to live at my apartment before moving next door and I still get his mail sometimes. \n I hopped in the car and started the engine. NPR starts playing and I tune in to the story unfolding. \n \n Frank Hartzel is 93, lives outside Philadelphia. These days, sweaters over collared shirts are kind of his thing. 75 years ago though, he didn't have the luxury of a signature look. It was just combat uniforms... \n \n I set my destination in my GPS and pull out of the complex to begin my drive. \n \n After the war, Frank went to Drexel and MIT. He worked his entire civilian life as a structural engineer, making sure buildings were safe. He's sharp, still talks with the precision of a engineer. \n \n I like the idea of being a structural engineer. Very similar to being an architect, which is what my sister, Melissa, is going to school for. There's something about the way \"the precision of an engineer\" rings true to me that makes me appreciate the story being told. \n As I continue to listen, it becomes apparent that this story is about war. But not just war. \n War crimes. \n In December 1944, during World War II, Nazi soldiers battled for control of the Belgian town of Chenogne during the Battle of the Bulge. Afterwards, dozens of unarmed German prisoners of war were executed. The American soldiers had orders to  take no prisoners , in direct violation of  the Geneva Conventions . \n I've been watching more movies lately, playing them in the background for ambience as I work from home. Two of them are movies about war. The first, being my new favorite,  The King , on Netflix about The Battle of Agincourt in 1415 (also immortalized by Shakespeare in  Henry V ). The second being  1917 , based on fragments of stories from World War 1. \n The irony in how war, massive events of death by battle, immortalizes those who fought and died in them is not lost on me. \n What's interesting to me isn't so much how history is written by the victors, as it is that remnants of the truth live on despite this. The story I was listening to on NPR was a testiment to that. \n For  George S. Patton , the events described in the Battle of the Bulge are remembered not only as a victory, but as a major achievement for him. \n And yet the truth lives on in the soldiers who carried out his orders, in the form of haunting regret. This truth is what is uncovered by the investigative journalist. Although the solider may never be free from the guilt of killing POWs, maybe his burden is alleviated in revealing the truth of what happened. \n \n The Truth Shall Set You Free. \n John 8:32 \n War as a State Machine \n I've been thinking a lot about war and how it's almost always a territory struggle, really. This is made especially clear in the movie,  The King . \n In the context of  Space Pirates , the game I've been working on, it's really a war simulation if territories were squares in space. \n Something else I've been interested in very much has been cryptocurrencies and the underlying  blockchain  technology. I really wanted to combine my two interests into this game. \n That's when I realized how I could: the blockchain is essentially an incorruptible, decentralized ledger of the truth. In finance, it's used to keep track of the state of wallets by tracking transactions that modify the wallet balances. This is basically a simple finite-state machine. \n We then see how some of the other cryptocurrencies like  EOS ,  NEO  and  Ethereum  build on this concept to facilitate the creation of more complex state machines in the form of  dApps  (decentralized applications) , even so far as to resemble  virtual computers . Indeed, Ethereum can execute  Turing-complete  scripts and the term  Virtual Machine  is thrown around alot in the crypto space. \n Since  Satoshi Nakamoto  invented the blockchain datastructure, it's now possible to create a record that can not only exist safely in a decentralized form, but can theoretically exist  forever \n These are very seductive features a game built as a dApp can have. As a gamer, I don't have to fear my game or my progress in the game will be erased when the game shuts down and as a game developer, my game will live on forever! \n The Game of Life \n One such game (not built on the blockchain but existing as a simple state machine of rules) is  John Conway's Game of Life \n \n The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. \n \n You can see here the  fun  I had when I first discovered this game. Basically, I discovered that there are many different  stable configurations  within the confines of Conway's simulated biology, which I had fun playing with. Interestingly, configurations which travel across the grid are called  spaceships . \n \n   \n \n So I decided to build a state machine that simulates the mechanics of the Space Pirates game I want to build. If you are aware, a state machine is a simple concept of a graph of nodes representing states that are linked together by transitions between those states. \n \n   \n   A simple state machine diagram. \n \n I realized you can model the states of a state machine as a database diagram. So I found  dbdiagram.io , which facilitates the easy creation of database diagrams. \n Here is the database diagram I came up with for Space Pirates: \n \n   \n    Space Pirates DB Diagram\n   \n //// -- LEVEL 1\n//// -- Tables and References\n\n// Characters\nTable Account {\n  id int [pk]\n  email varchar [unique]\n  password varchar\n}\n\nTable Character {\n  id int [pk]\n  account_id int [ref: > Account.id, note: 'null if NPC']\n  inventory_id int [ref: - Inventory.id]\n  title title\n  HP int\n  armor int\n  shields int\n  sex sex\n  species species\n  vitality int\n  strength int\n  speed int\n  intelligence int\n  charisma int\n  wisdom int\n  biography varchar\n  crew_id int [ref: - CharacterList.id]\n  profession profession [note: 'if NPC']\n  location location\n  location_id int [note: 'references an id of a relevant location.

I found this interesting as I, myself, am doing a case study on this song and this song was a part of a study in movement. An interesting  coincidence . \n Discovery \n I was listening to my Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify and came across this song. I immediately fell in love with it and started playing it on repeat. \n When I looked into it a little bit, I realized I had previously been enamored with another  BAYNK  song: Water. \n \n I had found that song on the start of my psychadelic journey and I really felt it (in addition to  Hallucinogenics - Valis Alps Remix )  defined my hallucinogenic experiences quite accurately. \n  Lyrics \n The song begins in the aftermath of some destruction. Sounds begin to fade in, growing, as if gathering or recollecting some thought. \n Pensive. \n \n Heavy hit, pavement \n \n Heavy hit. It's  ambiguous . Obviously, with the following  pavement , it means a physical hit, where we're now on the ground. But I feel it could also mean a heavy hit of some kind of drug, be it real or metaphorical. \n \n Spilled milk, broken glass \n \n Don't cry over spilt  milk . \n The classic image of an innocent childhood mistake is contrasted by the reality of the danger of broken glass in the mix. \n At this point, I'm vibing pretty hard. The song seems to permeate the air around me perfectly as I play it over spearkers; a perfectly repeating pattern. \n I look at my TV screen to see the name of the song: \n TESSELATE \n \n   \n   A  tesselation . \n \n \n Tessellate the ceiling \n Like you don't have everything at your feet \n \n Some kind of... resentment. Jealousy? \n A  genius  interpretation: \n \n Her lover isn’t literally tessellating the ceiling but he is too caught up in his mind, perhaps in shock after the violence that happened in the previous verse to snap out of it and look around and notice that he still has her. \n \n Chorus: \n \n How could you forget about me? \n \n Oh. How  could  you forget about her? She must not have been important enough to slip through his mind like that. \n Except... \n \n Every syllable you ever said \n \n I  did  remember  he whispers softly, even before her verse in the chorus. Which came  first ? Who's words weighs more? \n \n Say it like you mean it till you take it back \n \n Sometimes  words cut more sharply than glass . As someone who chooses their words very carefully, I find that I, too, am prone to reading too much into something someone might say in haste, which usually never ends well. \n \n Fixate, slowly \n Fillin' all the spaces in between \n \n As someone methodical, he fills in the spaces between, unable to leave a gap. Indeed, in a perfect tesselation, there is no gaps between patterns. \n \n How could you forget about me? \n \n Despite this, she somehow managed slip through the cracks; the space between the pattern. \n \n Counted every minute right before you left \n \n Maybe the relationship wasn't so perfect. Maybe he really couldn't wait until she left. \n Or perhaps, as methodical as we was, he counted the seconds, like you might count each grain of sand as it slips through an hourglass; fixated on it for how precious it is. \n \n Every syllable you ever said \n \n As long as his mind is not perfectly transparent, she may never know whether his actions were done in resentment or not. Sometimes, you just need some space and time to appreciate things better. \n \n \n"},{title:"TubeTV",frontmatter:{title:"TubeTV",date:"2021-01-09T00:00:00.000Z",description:"How I turned an old tube TV into another workspace.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"/images/boobtube.jpg",type:"post",tags:["Computer Science","Raspberry Pi","Memories"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/boobtube.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"TubeTV"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"How I turned an old tube TV into another workspace."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/boobtube.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/9/TubeTV.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"TubeTV"},{property:"og:description",content:"How I turned an old tube TV into another workspace."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/boobtube.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/9/TubeTV.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-09T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Computer Science"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Raspberry Pi"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"TubeTV"},{itemprop:"description",content:"How I turned an old tube TV into another workspace."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/boobtube.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/9/TubeTV.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/9/TubeTV.md",key:"v-44cf0cd3",path:"/blog/2021/1/9/TubeTV.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"The idea of the TubeTV",slug:"the-idea-of-the-tubetv"},{level:2,title:"Assembly Instructions",slug:"assembly-instructions"},{level:2,title:"1/20/2021 UPDATE",slug:"_1-20-2021-update"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" TubeTV \n I recently found myself in posession of an old tube TV.  You know what kind I'm talking about. \n \n   \n   Someone else  who scored a similar TV. \n \n I couldn't figure out what model it was, since if there was a sticker on the back revealing that information, it had long since peeled off and/or faded away into obscurity. It's a Mitsubishi similar to the one shown above. \n I found it lying in front of someone's yard. Coincidentally, I was actually on my way to pick up an entertainment center. I've been picking up a lot of used furniture to furnish my apartment lately. I also recently acquired a  rug . \n \n I copped that for $20 bucks! What a bargain! \n The TV was free, not only as it was just sitting there, but because it had a black garbage bag duck-tapped over it and a piece of paper taped to the front of it that declared  FREE TV! IT WORKS! \n I was feelin' mighty appreciative at this point in my life so I was eternally grateful to be blessed with another TV in my house, as I figured I could use it upstairs or do something fun with it. \n Besides, it had that  nostalgia  factor to it that I couldn't resist. \n Funny enough, the TV now sits on the entertainment center I picked up. \n The idea of the TubeTV \n I figured out right quick what that  something fun  I was going to do with it was! \n As I was organizing my apartment, I pulled out of the closet an extra keyboard that I had lying around and placed it on top of the TV. It fit the vibe. \n \n   \n   Praised by computer enthusiasts and frequent typists alike due to their durability and consistency, and the tactile and auditory feedback they provide. \n \n That keyboard is an  IBM Model M , made famous for it's unique  buckling spring  keys. Or at least the  closest  thing to it. There's a  long history  to it. \n Anyway, I realized with all the blog posts I've been writing, it would be nice to be able to use this keyboard again. Why, I could even hook it up to the ol' TubeTV to complete the nostalgic vibe I had going on! \n I threw away my old laptop when I moved, unfortunately, so I didn't have something I could hook up to the TV. I held onto my old laptop for so long because I loved the keyboard on it. (You'll notice a theme here.) It was also my first laptop, so it had extra sentimental value as well. \n \n Alas, this could finally be the good excuse I needed to buy a  Raspberry Pi ! \n Since most of my blog posts are created by writing  markdown files  locally and then commiting them with  git , I figured I could cobble together a simple writing workstation that would fit my needs. It might even prove to be a more distraction-free environment I could focus with! \n Assembly Instructions \n A Raspberry Pi recipe: \n 1x Raspberry Pi\n1x Model M keyboard\n1x RCA adapter\n \n Okay, I know that much at least. But I'm not sure what Raspbery Pi unit specifically I should get. Let's review my requirements to find one that fits my needs: \n \n Wifi connection \n USB port \n Able to connect to an RCA adapter \n Able to plug into a wall outlet \n SD card memory \n \n OK. A quick google search led me to  this  article, which tells me what I'm looking for is an  A/V Composite cable . The new Raspberry Pi models use a  4-pole Audio Jack , which carries both audio and video signals. It’s similar to sockets found on other multimedia devices such as iPods, MP3 players and smartphones. \n Perfect. I'll buy one. $9 bucks. \n Awesome. Now I know that I can just get the newest  Raspberry Pi 4  and rest assured it will come compatible with my RCA cable. \n Add on a few bells and whistles and BOOM! $120 bucks. I'll swing that. \n \n So for about $130, I can have a cheap PC and a new work environment. Sold. \n Between my art project and fun money, it falls within my  budget  for this month, too. \n That's that! I'll post an update picture when it all arrives and I have it set up. \n 1/20/2021 UPDATE \n \n Once it arrived, I realized very quickly that I had neither a micro HDMI cable nor the patience for my RCA cable to arrive to connect my device to a display. \n A quick google search and I found an  HDMI to RCA converter  at my local walmart. \n A quick trip over there and I ended up finding everything I needed. I walked out with the converter, a  micro HDMI to HDMI  cable, and an extra HDMI and RCA cable. \n I was stoked. \n I rushed home to finish baking my Pi. Once I had it assembled, I realized I overlooked one important detail: I didn't have enough outlets. I already had my TV and record player hooked up to the only outlet on the wall. \n I went upstairs and played tetris with my PC cables to try and salvage the only other power strip in the house I could spare. I realized one of the outlets I had previously assumed was broken was in fact powered by a light switch. Great! I plugged in my lamp to it and it freed up an outlet. Rearranging my modem and router on the floor, I was able to plug them into a separate outlet. \n Awesome. I now had a free power strip. I ran downstairs and plugged in all the pieces: HDMI to RCA converter plugged into my Pi as a power source, micro HDMI to HDMI adapter cable connected to my Pi, the extra HDMI cable I bought connecting the adapter cable to the converter and finally, the RCA cable to the TV. \n BOOM. It worked instantly. \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n I was very pleased with my new set up. I spent the next few hours messing around with the display settings. \n The SD card I bought that came with the Raspberry Pi contained the  NOOBS  software preloaded on it. This booted up the  Raspberry Pi OS , which seemed to be a flavor of  Debian . \n I had previously used a Debian system with one of the first linux operating systems I used on my HP Pavilion dv9000:  CrunchBang . Support for it was eventually dropped by the developer in favor of using vanilla Debian, but it was a personal favorite of mine for a long time. \n Good times. \n I'll keep the Raspberry Pi OS for now out of convenience, at least until I switch the  window manager  to  my version  of  dwm . \n I'm very happy with my new setup and I think I'll keep the screensaver on during the day for aesthetics. \n \n \n \n"},{title:"Life Update: Seattle",frontmatter:{title:"Life Update: Seattle",date:"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Big news!",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Goals","Memories"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Seattle.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Life Update: Seattle"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Big news!"},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Seattle.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/10/1/Life-Update-Seattle.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Life Update: Seattle"},{property:"og:description",content:"Big news!"},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Seattle.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/10/1/Life-Update-Seattle.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Goals"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Life Update: Seattle"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Big news!"},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Seattle.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/10/1/Life-Update-Seattle.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/10/1/Life-Update-Seattle.md",key:"v-29a60b39",path:"/blog/2021/10/1/Life-Update-Seattle.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Interviewing",slug:"interviewing"},{level:2,title:"The Move",slug:"the-move"},{level:2,title:"Chicago",slug:"chicago"},{level:2,title:"Seattle",slug:"seattle"}],lastUpdated:"10/2/2021, 3:42:12 AM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1633160532e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n Exciting news! A lot has happened since my last update. I haven't really posted about it because I've been so busy, but anyway, here it is: \n I got a job at Amazon! \n Amazing , I know. Between preparing to interview, interviewing and the logistics of moving to Seattle, I feel like I've barely had any time to document my journey. \n Let's start at the beginning, shall we? \n So way back at the beginning of June, I picked up a shiny new graphics card, the  NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti . It's a great card and it really allowed me to play and fully enjoy a lot of games that had previously been sitting idle in my library. However, after installing it, I realized I had \"broken\" my FreeBSD setup. Basically, I could boot into the shell but starting the  X display server  failed because I needed to upgrade the drivers I was using. \n Because I was lazy, I just didn't boot into it and stayed in Windows, happily consuming my time playing video games in high definition. That's why I didn't post very many updates. \n Interviewing \n Anyway, it was around this time that a recruiter from Google contacted me. At first I said I'd be ready to interview whenever, but then after some consideration, I realized I should maximize the time I had available to prepare for the interview. I called him back and basically asked for the latest time I could schedule for the interview. \n Fun Fact:  Actually, in reviewing my emails as I was preparing to write this article, I realized that this was the same recruiter who I had had a conversation with back in July of 2020. At the time, I was looking for a job after losing my job at RP Funding. I just got a job offer from nCino, however, so I decided to not proceed to the technical part of the interview but told my recruiter that I would like to stay in touch in the future. This was before I set up my blog towards the end of 2020, so there is some missing history there. \n This wasn't the first time I had tried to apply to a big tech company. In fact, when talking to my recruiter once, I asked what about my resume made me stand out to him as a potential candidate. He told me I had a good resume but that it was also based on positive feedback from the last time I interviewed. \n I was a bit surprised by this and thought back to when the last time that was, since it surely would have been during my early college years. And indeed, it was! I don't think it was  this  instance, but some time in 2013, maybe. \n Regardless, this wasn't my first rodeo. I knew what to expect with these types of interviews so I needed to brush up on some of my CS fundamentals. \n For the record, I used  this helpful article  as targeted practice for coding problems. I also studied (and prayed) with the Interview Bible:  Cracking the Coding Interview . Like any good bible, I needed to buy a new copy because I lost my other one lending it out to a friend in need. 😇 \n Coincidentally, around this time in my emails I also received an invitation to apply to Amazon as a SDE II. Keep in mind that although I usually don't explicitly state it in my  goals , it has been a lifelong goal of mine to: \n \n Get a job at a big tech company (with Google as my top pick) \n Move out to the west coast \n Own a beach house in Cali \n \n All of them are pretty interconnected and really serve to accomplish my dream of owning a west coast beach house. So to me, the goal of getting a job at a big tech company was relative. \n I decided to proceed with an Amazon interview as well since I was going to be preparing to interview at Google anyway. \n Fuck it , I thought.  Might as well apply to all my dream jobs while we're at it.  I then submitted my resume to Riot Games and CCP games as well. Microsoft had a weird recruiting event they wanted me to attend but I kept missing it and the position was in Atlanta anyway, which I wasn't thrilled about so I just dropped Microsoft. \n I heard back from Riot games and was excited about the possibility of working at probably my most literal dream job, especially when I found out they were based in LA. Unfortunately, I didn't even make it pass the behavioural interview, which I won't lie, concerned me a little. \n The good news, however, was that I did well with the initial technical screening interview for Google and the coding assessment with Amazon. When the time came for the full virtual onsite interview... I bombed it. \n At least the Google one. It was five 1-hour interviews, all of them technical. The Amazon one felt a bit easier as it was four 1-hour interviews, with the first half reserved for behavioural questions. If you didn't know, Amazon is really big on their  Leadership Principles . I also got a bit better of a vibe from the Amazon interviewers; I felt pretty stress free during the interviews and enjoyed talking to them with the questions I got to ask. \n The Move \n Spoiler alert: I got the job at Amazon! Haha, I definitely accepted right away just because I had that you-know-in-the-back-of-your-mind feeling that I wasn't going to get the job at Google. \n I put in my 2-weeks notice the same day I found out. Not that I was in a rush to leave, but timing-wise, it kind of worked out best if I did so when I did. Unfortunately, I had just signed a new lease with my apartment, which I couldn't really do anything about, but 2 weeks later would be the end of the month of August, which worked out great logistically for everything involving the move. \n By the way, I ended up only getting offered a SDE I position, which was fine by me, especially since they made it sound like I should be able to move up to SDE II within a year. It sounded like, however, I would only have 3 places available to me to relocate to: Boston, Massachusetts; Arlington, Virginia; or Seattle, Washington. \n Pretty easy choice, if you ask me.  (And they did!) \n So, logistically, moving was pretty interesting. First of all, I got a nice moving package, which helped, but also came right outta my paycheck, I later found out. 😒 \n I basically decided to have all my stuff moved into a POD container, have them ship it out to Seattle, and then move it into my apartment there. Then, I decided I would drive my car up to Chicago, where my twin sister was staying, and giver her my car before continuing my journey up to Seattle by plane. \n During the brief span of time between when I left my job and drove up to Chicago, I took the opportunity as a micro-vacation and bought myself some sketch books. I hope to devote some more time to improving my  art  skills, since it was originally a  defining  passion of mine. \n I drew a quick sketch of the communal area in front of my apartment, where good times were had. \n Chicago \n The drive up to Chicago was long and uninteresting. Mostly. Driving through the mountains in Virginia was actually very beautiful. \n The drive  into  Chicago, though, was incredible in it's own right. Chicago is  huge ! I really was not prepared for it. Immediately driving into the city I was met with a beautiful skyline of iconic skyscrapers. What really baffled me was how they skyline continued even as I passed the initial \"downtown\" area. The city was dense with apartments, cars and pedestrians. I played Sufjan's Stevens  Illinois  album as I sat staring in wonder at the buildings from the car, starting with the track  Come on! Feel the Illinoise! , naturally. \n \n My sister and her girlfriend were out of town attending a wedding so I stayed at their place near Uptown. I had a really great time exploring the city. Parking was a nightmare, so I just walked everywhere. I thought of it as a primer to my new lifestyle. She lived really close to the Cubs stadium, so that probably didn't help either. \n \n The time finally came to pick Tina and Anne up from the airport and I was very excited to see my long lost twin! Kidding about the long part, but I hadn't seen her in a long time and it was cool to see her and Anne as locals in Chicago. That week was also my first week of starting my job remotely. I pretty much worked in their office while Anne went into her office to work during the day. \n Christina gave me a grand culinary tour of Chicago, spoiling me with so many good food places. I realized I really have been sleeping on good ethnic food. Probably my favorite place we ate at was a literal hole-in-the wall called Chilam Balam. It was a quaint Mexican place next to an alley with a sign and some steps that led down into the indoor dining area. There were some tables in the alley for dining outside and it was BYO wine (apparently it's hard to get a liquor license in Chicago so BYOB is not uncommon), which we brought with us in a little tote. \n \n There was a small menu and the move was to order a couple entrée's for each of us. Every plate brought out to us was so delicious and we had some flan to top things off. \n We continued on to a local movie theater (which was somewhat foreign to me having lived for so long where AMC or Regal were the only options) and watched the new Marvel movie,  Shang Chi . I thought it was great! And so did Christina. I wish I had written a review shortly after seeing it because I had much praise for it. \n Seattle \n Finally, the time had come for Christina and Anne to return the favor and drop me off at the airport. I was very excited to get to Seattle and explore the city. I would be staying in a hotel for a few days before I got to move into my apartment. \n     @rockzombie2   ##seattle   ♬ i'm closing my eyes (feat. shiloh) - potsu       \n It's awesome. \n Now that I've finally got all my stuff moved into my apartment and I just got my first paycheck, I'm going to start improving my lifestyle; creating more content, working towards my goals (always!), improving my health and developing myself and my skill sets. I'm eternally grateful for the cosmic forces that have aligned my will, effort and opportunity to get me to where I am today. \n It's almost the end of the year and I haven't quite managed to make much progress on  my yearly goals , but I'm satisfied to know I've finally achieved some of my lifelong goals. \n \n Get a job at a big tech company (with Google as my top pick) \n Move out to the west coast \n Own a beach house in Cali \n \n \n \n"},{title:"Designing a Blockchain from the Ground Up",frontmatter:{title:"Designing a Blockchain from the Ground Up",date:"2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z",description:"After researching blockchains, I decided to attempt to design one from the ground up for Space Pirates.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Space Pirates","Blockchain","Analysis"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Designing a Blockchain from the Ground Up"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"After researching blockchains, I decided to attempt to design one from the ground up for Space Pirates."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/17/Blockchain-Design.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Designing a Blockchain from the Ground Up"},{property:"og:description",content:"After researching blockchains, I decided to attempt to design one from the ground up for Space Pirates."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.jpeg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/17/Blockchain-Design.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Blockchain"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Analysis"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Designing a Blockchain from the Ground Up"},{itemprop:"description",content:"After researching blockchains, I decided to attempt to design one from the ground up for Space Pirates."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/blockchain.jpeg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/11/17/Blockchain-Design.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/11/17/Blockchain-Design.md",key:"v-0441e936",path:"/blog/2021/11/17/Blockchain-Design.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Why not use an existing blockchain?",slug:"why-not-use-an-existing-blockchain"},{level:2,title:"Why not use a sidechain on an existing blockchain?",slug:"why-not-use-a-sidechain-on-an-existing-blockchain"},{level:2,title:"Designing a Blockchain from the Ground Up",slug:"designing-a-blockchain-from-the-ground-up"}],lastUpdated:"11/18/2021, 1:33:03 AM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1637217183e3,content:' {{ $page.title }} \n \n I  previously  had  analyzed  some blockchains as potential candidates to use for the  Space Pirates  game. At the time, I was mostly convinced that EOS would be the best blockchain for me to use. However, since then I\'ve identified certain requirements that I want for the game that has made me re-evaluate this decision out of necessity. \n So far, the requirements I have for this game include: \n \n An in-game currency with the same properties that make bitcoin a  sound  currency, namely, that it has:\n \n durability \n portability \n divisibility \n uniformity \n limited supply \n and acceptability. [ 1 ] \n \n \n I don\'t want the in game currency to be monopolized by the "miners" of the blockchain, meaning ideally, everyone has a fair chance of acquiring in game currency through their actions in the game (or "on-chain"). This means that the currency is not "mined" by the "miners" of the blockchain, but they players. \n At the same time, there should be some incentive for "miners" to contribute to the network. Therefore, some in-game incentive is required, ideally not in the form of currency directly (minted). \n Like bitcoin, the blockchain should be completely decentralized. \n \n After I had made the realization that these were the requirements I wanted to have in my game, I started thinking abount the in-game currency, especially how it would be minted. This led me to re-consider creating my own blockchain. \n  Why not use an existing blockchain? \n First I had to come to terms with the blockchain I had chosen. EOS was ideal for it\'s high transactions-per-second. However, it achieves this at the expense of it\'s decentralization. One of the downsides of  DPoS  systems is that they are vulnerable to centralization as a number of witnesses is strictly limited. \n I also realized I could have the in-game currency be distributed in game, as I wanted, in EOS, without having to worry about compensating miners (or "witnesses" in EOS\'s case) by having the game run on the EOS main net. However, this would then create a disconnect between the in-game ecosystem and the EOS ecosystem that the game runs on; the game would be at the mercy of the sustainability of the blockchain, with no direct incentives offered to the witnesses who run the blockchain the game depends on. \n I realized the blockchain I chose for the game would be tied more closely to the "miners" incentives than I had initially considered. \n  Why not use a sidechain on an existing blockchain? \n In doing some research into the technology some existing decentralized games ran on, I found one called  Axie Infinity . \n I watched some footage of the game and it played like on old school turn-based rpg that, surprisingly, seemed to run pretty smoothly. I understood it ran on the Ethereum network, but what I didn\'t understand was how it seemed to get around all the gas fees. As I understood it, the game would exist as a collection of smart contracts, with every call to such a contract requiring an gas fee to be paid. \n Clearly, it didn\'t seem that the players were paying such fees. Were the game developers fronting all the costs, then? That was the case for EOS, I knew, from my previous research, but I couldn\'t find a straight answer to this question for this game. \n Just kidding,  I found the answer . \n This made me consider possibly using an existing blockchain for settling transactions and a sidechain for actually handling all of the micro-transactions (not those kind) of the game. \n I quickly dismissed this idea because of the disconnect reason I mentioned previously. \n Designing a Blockchain from the Ground Up \n Therefore, I decided it was time to seriously consider designing my own blockchain specifically for the game. \n I started consuming content, learning about the different types of blockchains, which are mostly distinguished by the consensus algorithms they use. \n \n   \n \n I found this video very enlightening, especially because it put me on to  Proof of Space . I personally think Proof of Work is pretty secure, especially given it\'s track record, but it is very expensive to mine. From what I understoon from the video, Proof of Space is essentially Proof of Work, except the work can be done before-hand, stored on a hard drive and used in the future. The cost is comparable to Proof of Work, except rather than paying with electricity, you pay with storage. \n I started looking some of the research papers on the subject, such as the  paper  on Proof of Space, as well as a specific implementation of it, called  Space Mint . \n \n \n Warning:  This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it:  Download PDF .\n \n \n Curiously, it seems to have just... died. No clear cause of death, either. Doing some more digging, it seemed like it paved the way for some of the same authors to develop Proof of Space-Time, which they used for their Chia coin (which I quickly realized was a complete scam after reading the  "whitepaper" ). \n I asked a crypto slack channel at work if anyone had any idea as to why Proof of Space seemed to be so... unpopular. Someone mentioned that if it was supposed to be more "green", then Proof of Stake was simply "greener", since it didn\'t rely on having to use so many hard drives. \n From what I gathered, it seemed to me that there wasn\'t anything particularly wrong with Proof of Space and it could work better for my needs as a blockchain, given that it evens the playing field for miners, as it allows anyone with access to a hard drive the chance to mine the next block. \n So that\'s what I\'ve decided to go with for now and try to design a blockchain that uses the Proof of Space algorithm for consensus. However, I think rather than rewarding miners with in-game currency (which will be mined in-game), I would reward miners with other in-game incentives, namely discover of new systems, or galaxies, in the in-game universe. \n I figure the way this could work is by expanding the known universe with new galaxies every 210,000 blocks or so, in the same fashion that bitcoin block rewards halve. Then reward miners with the credit for discovering wormholes, which enable instantaneous travel between random galaxies. The reward for the miner is that anyone travelling through these gates would pay a fee to the "discoverer". This should hopefully act the same as the transaction fees that are paid to miners typically on a cryptocurrency blockchain like bitcoin. \n Next, I\'ll tackle designing this concept technically, possibly as a prototype in C or some Rust with the help of  this guy . \n \n \n'},{title:"Squid Game & Do It To It (Zedd Edit)",frontmatter:{title:"Squid Game & Do It To It (Zedd Edit)",date:"2021-11-06T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A catchy song I came across on TikTok.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DxzdRri8o6o/0.jpg",type:"post",tags:["Case Study","Music"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DxzdRri8o6o/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Squid Game & Do It To It (Zedd Edit)"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A catchy song I came across on TikTok."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DxzdRri8o6o/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/6/Squid-Game-and-Do-It-To-It.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Squid Game & Do It To It (Zedd Edit)"},{property:"og:description",content:"A catchy song I came across on TikTok."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DxzdRri8o6o/0.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/6/Squid-Game-and-Do-It-To-It.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-11-06T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Case Study"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Music"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Squid Game & Do It To It (Zedd Edit)"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A catchy song I came across on TikTok."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DxzdRri8o6o/0.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/11/6/Squid-Game-and-Do-It-To-It.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/11/6/Squid-Game-and-Do-It-To-It.md",key:"v-f360afb6",path:"/blog/2021/11/6/Squid-Game-and-Do-It-To-It.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Release",slug:"release"},{level:2,title:"Discovery",slug:"discovery"}],lastUpdated:"11/7/2021, 2:15:56 AM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1636269356e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n   \n \n EDC  is an interesting music festival to me. I think there are a lot of good EDM artists that end up headlining at it, and while I enjoy listening to them and think a lot of them would be good live, I doubt you would ever find me attending such a festival. \n These festivals whose lineup is almost exclusively  EDM  tend to attract a specific crowd, or so I've noticed. See, when I was going to college in Orlando, festival season would roll around and I would see and hear different people talking excitedly about their outfits they'd picked out for EDC. I have a suspicion that most of those types of people were the type to also join fraternities and sororities. I didn't know any of them close enough to confirm this-- I generally tended to avoid them. Probably because the best way I could find to describe them was  extra . Or maybe I'm just pretentious. \n Regardless, even though EDM festivals are places I avoid, it doesn't mean I don't appreciate a lot of the music coming out of it. \n Fun Fact!  At one point in my life I actually used to live very close to  Tinker Field , where EDC Orlando is held, on the infamous  OBT . Not a very fun point in my life and perhaps part of the reason I was never impressed with the festival to begin with. \n Release \n EDC Las Vegas happened in October, where Zedd dropped a mashup between 23's  Pink Soldiers  from Netflix's wildly popular show  Squid Game  and Acraze's lead single  Do It To It . \n Discovery \n I discovered this song right around the time it dropped on Tik Tok, of course. I have to say, I was pretty impressed with the song; it was very catchy and complemented the already iconic song from  Squid Game . \n     @zedd   …wait for it 😏🦑 @EDC Las Vegas   ♬ original sound - Zedd       \n Browsing through the comments, I found a few that were similar to this one: \n \n @vanursa:Me in bed rn 🦗🦟🦗🦗🦟🦗 \n \n That cracked me up. It was pretty fucking funny! \n For some reason the image of a bunch of girls at home in bed, all watching this TikTok \"popping\" their backs in the same fashion these little bug emoji's implied amused me to no end. \n A few days later, I came back to this TikTok, honestly to find the cricket comment which had kept me amused the past few days. I also wanted to find the song but it was funny to me that this was almost a secondary reason. \n I found it easily enough on YouTube, where I could hear the full studio quality of it. I was very impressed with it. The production on it was very clean. Especially on the intro; if you recognize the original track from the show, you'll notice the slight stutters Zedd introduces to the vocalizations that really elevate it to a proper EDM intro. \n That's it. It's a catchy song. 🦗🦟🦗🦟 \n \n \n"},{title:"Space Pirates Roadmap",frontmatter:{title:"Space Pirates Roadmap",date:"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z",description:"The roadmap for Space Pirates.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"images/techtree.png",type:"post",tags:["Space Pirates"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/techtree.png"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Space Pirates Roadmap"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"The roadmap for Space Pirates."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/techtree.png"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/7/Roadmap.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Space Pirates Roadmap"},{property:"og:description",content:"The roadmap for Space Pirates."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/techtree.png"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/7/Roadmap.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Space Pirates Roadmap"},{itemprop:"description",content:"The roadmap for Space Pirates."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/techtree.png"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/11/7/Roadmap.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/11/7/Roadmap.md",key:"v-23bda19d",path:"/blog/2021/11/7/Roadmap.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Phase 1",slug:"phase-1"},{level:2,title:"Phase 2",slug:"phase-2"},{level:2,title:"Phase 3",slug:"phase-3"},{level:2,title:"Phase 4",slug:"phase-4"},{level:2,title:"Phase 5",slug:"phase-5"},{level:2,title:"Phase 6",slug:"phase-6"},{level:2,title:"Phase 7",slug:"phase-7"}],lastUpdated:"11/7/2021, 7:11:33 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1636330293e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Below is an overview of the roadmap I have planned so far for the Space Pirates game. \n \n I don't have any specific deadlines for each of these phases, although I did mention it was  one of my goals  to create a working prototype of the game by the end of the year. It is currently November, so I don't think I'll be achieving that goal, but I'm a little lenient on myself for that considering I  acheived  another life-long goal of mine anyway. \n I think setting a deadline for myself isn't very necessary 1. becauase I'm under no obligation to anyone to complete this game (especially since I intend for it to be a free game) and 2. I want to take as much time as I need to ensure the quality of this game is exceptional. Imposing a deadline for myself, I feel, would subconsciously affect the time I spend and in turn, the quality of the game. \n Phase 1 \n As I mentioned, designing the game will take a large amount of time and effort in order to get everything right. \n To break it down, lets consider all the aspects of the game that need to be designed in order to completely describe the game. \n Resources \n First, I need to identify all the resourcese that are available in the game. For example, things  like money, raw resources (commodities), refined goods (such as metals) and end products, like weapons and ship systems and modifications. \n Once I have those established, it basically defines the \"pieces\" that will be on the board. From there I can also determine if I want any of those resources to be unique and if I should turn them into NFT's. Things like NPC characters, perhaps are what I'm considering as candidates for non-fungibility. This decision spawns a whole other discussion on the logistics of minting NFT's, but that kind of falls under the next aspect of the game. \n Resource Inflation Curve \n Next, I need to determine how exactly each resource is spawned. Take, for example, an unrefined mineral that is found in asteroids. Perhaps this can be refined into the fuel for spaceships. What happens when a player completely mines out an asteroid? Does the asteroid respawn? \n There are a lot of implications to the answer of this scenario that need to be considered since the game is run on the blockchain. If the supply of fuel for ships is bottlenecked by the respawn rate of asteroids, what should the respawn rate be in order to prevent a shortage of such a vital resource and prevent the game from grinding to a halt? \n Additionally, if fuel is a necessary component for space travel (and travel to the asteroids containg said mineral) should there be an initial supply of fuel available for purchase at the games genesis? If so, how much should there be? \n Alternatively, lets say there is no respawn rate of the mineral required for fuel. All the minerals of that resource that will ever exist in the game do as at the start of the game. Does this mean the game will inevitably cease to function when the well dries up? \n These considerations apply to all the resources, including the currency that is used in game. Should new players start with some \"cash\"? But if they do, how do you prevent this mechanic from being abused? How then is \"new\" cash mined (or minted)? Is it inflationary or deflationary? \n When it comes to the in game currency, I'd like to take my inspiration from  Bitcoin , in the sense that it defines the properties of hard money. In terms of the other in game mechanics, I'd like to stay as true to science as possible, namely in that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Essentially, this will spell out a  cold death  for the game in the long run, but perhaps I can make it a long time and a worthwhile. For example, all bitcoin will be mined after 120 years, so maybe I can have the game run for a similar amount of  time . The difference, though, is that bitcoin can continue to operate indefinitely because each bitcoin can be subdivided. That might not be the case with \"matter\" as it relates to my game. \n The point being that these \"curves\" need to be considered with the intended longevity of the game. Finite or  infinite ? \n The Scoreboard at The End of Time \n If the end state of the game is essentially heat-death, what is the point of it? I could smile and say  it's about the journey , and while I would be right, I'm sure there are a lot of people who would roll their eyes and journey elsewhere. \n There has to be an incentive for the player to care about their actions in the game. One of the most gloriously motivating features utilized in games both  old  and  new  is the High Score Board. \n What if at the final state of the game, all that was left would be a high score board, immortalizing all the players who reached the top. \n The question then would be,  okay; how do I get points? \n I need to be very careful in how deciding how points are awarded (if I go this route) because depending on the activity the points reward, it will clearly incentivize players to do that activity, for better or worse. \n Crafting Tree \n Once all of the base resources have been identified, I can then start identifying what items refine into, what they can be combined to produce and in turn, the final products that can be achieved through different steps of refinement and combination. \n Defining these combinations should create a heirarchical relationship between commodities and the products they produce, aka. a crafting tree. \n \n   \n   An example of a tech tree from the game EVE Online. \n \n Player Actions \n Essentially every action in the game will be a call and an execution of a smart contract. If you think of the game as a state machine, every call to a smart contract is a potential transition of a state stored on the blockchain. Therefore, I need to clearly define every action that is possible in the game and then create a smart contract for it. \n Some examples include carfting, exploration, running planetary governments, combat, etc. \n Player Stats \n Once I've defined what the players can  do , I can then introduce factors that contribute to the success or failure of those actions via player stats and skills. One of the most widely used core mechanics of any kind of RPG is that of the skill checks with or against player stats, such as the ones used in  Dungeons & Dragons . \n \n \n \n Warning:  This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it:  Download PDF .\n \n \n I remember reading through the manual of one of my favorite games on the OG Xbox and realizing how the mechanics of it were almost exactly the same as those used in D&D. \n \n Essentially, the player stats (Charisma, Dexterity, Wisdom, etc.) will contribute to contribute to the success or failure of relevant actions taken by the player (or NPC). Once I come up with these core attributes (they're gonna be the same as the ones in D&D) then I can come up with the skills that use these attributes. \n From there, I think I'm going to have it so that skills can be leveled up, which implies a skill tree for leveling up in. I want there to be some kind of tradeoff (most likely time devoted, similar to how EVE Online works) between which skills are chosen and the benefits gained from it. There needs to be some kind of opportunity cost for teching into a skill. If I end up making it so the game reaches an end-game state, then I might make it impossible to level every skill before the end of the game occurs. \n States in the State Machine \n Finally, once all of these components of the game have been defined, I can derive the states that will be possible in the game. From here, it should be a simple matter to draft up the smart contracts that will represent those states in the game. \n Phase 2 \n Phase 2 will involve actually implementing the game. The smart contracts are the most important part of the game, so creating these will present a minimum viable product to test with. From here, this prototype may reveal unkown elements of the game that may influence it's direction, so this is an important part. \n I'm also planning on drafting a white paper that describes the game in theory, agnostic from the blockchain it's actually implemented on. \n Phase 3 \n The third phase will involve creating a browser-client to play the game with. Up until this point, the game will have mostly existed on the blockchain as smart contracts, only being interfaced with directly, most likely from the command line. \n The goal of the web-based client will be to have an official client which can be used to demo the game and enable generally access to the underlying game running on the blockchain. \n Phase 4 \n The purpose of the beta testing phase will be to mostly refine values, fix client bugs and run simulations to see if the game is scaleable into the future. Opening up the game to be beta-tested as well will hopefully reveal any issues present with the game as far as supply and demand is concerned. \n Phase 5 \n After the beta-testing phase, hopefully the game is ready to market. This means promoting it on social media for the purpose of generating enough interest in the game to populate it with players on release. Depending on how I decide to do NFT's in the game, this could also be an important period during which I can drum up hype for the NFT's (to sell, possibly) in order to hopefully transition that hype into the game itself. \n I also have some ideas for creating a Kickstarter or some other form of crowd-funding to raise funds needed to hire (mostly) artists and music for the game. I admit, I've had my sights set on  Colin Stetson  creating music for this game for a long time. I even have an old playlist to prove it. \n \n I'm pretty sure Colin Stetson is not within my budget currently, but maybe by the time I have a finished product ready to market, I could recruit his talent. \n During this time, finishing touches and refinements will continue to take place until the game is ready to launch. \n Phase 6 \n Finally! The game launches.  My lifelong dream  of creating the Space Pirates game will be complete! \n Phase 7 \n Now that the game is completed, I can start working on alternative clients for the game. So far, I have two ideas for alternative clients. One would be a retro 3D game, akin to Star Wars: Dark Forces II. \n \n The other would be a text based game played in the terminal. I recently came across  this  guy's twitter who is working on his own game inspired by old school rpgs, and I found his style endearing and very similar to what I would like do for this terminal client. \n and the title was done, a bit more minima-mystic  #syldhur   #indiegamedev   #gamedevelopment   #roguelike   #gamedev   #indiegames   #GameMaker   pic.twitter.com/73o4XvnMCl — Andrea Magnelli (@jamsus11)  February 19, 2021   \n For the terminal client, I think it would look something like this: \n \n But that's a very long ways away. Right now, I'm actually glad I wrote down all the thoughts that were in my head regarding my plans for this game because now I have a concrete road map to follow, which really helps direct my focus. \n \n \n"},{title:"Cloud Nothings",frontmatter:{title:"Cloud Nothings",date:"2021-11-08T00:00:00.000Z",description:"I got to see a band I really like and get a signed copy of an album I've been listening to for years.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Music","Memories"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/attackonmemory.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Cloud Nothings"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"I got to see a band I really like and get a signed copy of an album I've been listening to for years."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/attackonmemory.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/8/Cloud-Nothings.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Cloud Nothings"},{property:"og:description",content:"I got to see a band I really like and get a signed copy of an album I've been listening to for years."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/attackonmemory.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/11/8/Cloud-Nothings.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-11-08T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Music"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Cloud Nothings"},{itemprop:"description",content:"I got to see a band I really like and get a signed copy of an album I've been listening to for years."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/attackonmemory.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/11/8/Cloud-Nothings.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/11/8/Cloud-Nothings.md",key:"v-48918985",path:"/blog/2021/11/8/Cloud-Nothings.html",lastUpdated:"11/9/2021, 4:25:41 AM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1636449941e3,content:' {{ $page.title }} \n \n Cloud Nothings are awesome. \n They had such an impact on me in my formative years after high school. I\'m pretty sure I discovered them right as they released their second album (third LP overall),  Attack on Memory  because of a  Pitchfork review . Or maybe it was from watching  The Needle Drop\'s  review. \n \n   \n \n I remember my good friend  Dougie  had introduced me to The Needle Drop, and it was around this time that I was heavily into my discovering-new-music phase of my  music listening cycle  (the other phase being listening-to-the-same-music-over-and-over-again). \n I also enjoyed reading through Pitchfork articles, not because they were any good (it\'s pretty well regarded that Pitchfork is  pretentious ), but becuase I enjoyed expanding my vocabulary with words and expressions I could use to describe music. \n Looking back now, I\'m pleased to see this album was awarded Best New Music because that, along with the beautiful cover of the album, is what I remember attracting me to it. \n For context, I was a really big fan of what I dubbed  garage rock , music with a DIY attitude. One of the bands I was into in high school was The Thermals. You can probably see from this the paralells to Cloud Nothings. \n \n   \n     \n   \n   I find it hilarious that GearHead1087\'s video has more views than the bands  official  YouTube video. \n  \n Anyway, my music tastes and listening habits varied wildly over the course of my developing twenties, but Cloud Nothings\'  Attack on Memory  held a warm fuzzy spot in my heart. It served as my anthem of disaffection, my sonic flag of rebellion I waved with pride. \n \nNO FUTURE! NO PAST!\n \n I thought I would be more than this<br> I thought I would be more than this<br> I thought I would be more than this<br> I thought I would be more than this ― Cloud Nothings – Wasted Days \n It also paired nicely with my skateboarding habit. \n Fast forward a few years and I\'m living in  Seattle ! Living in a big city again, I  immediately  started going to local shows. There were plenty of nice venues around me, most of which I could get to via Lyft, some of which I could even walk to. \n By chance , I discovered Cloud Nothings were playing near me. I was stoked. I looked into what they\'d been up to since last I listened to them and found that their latest album that they were touring for,  The Shadow I Remember , was something of a return-to-roots album since it was recorded with the producer of their  Attack on Memory  album. What an interesting  coincidence  that links my occurrence with the band with the connection between these two albums. \n \n   Fun fact!   Songkick  is pretty awesome for keeping track of shows. If you sync your  Spotify  account with them, you can get notified any time an artist you follow is playing near you. You have to remember to follow artists on  Spotify ! \n   What I would recommend is adding the Songkick calendar to your own calendar via iCal so then when you look at your month, any concerts you might be interested will already be on there! \n \n The day of the show (tonight for me, November 8th, 2021 for you) I could have walked to the venue and I was planning on it until my brother called me. I talked to him for a while until I had to leave. I threw on my  jacket  and got a Lyft to the venue. \n I was a little confused when I first got there because I was dropped off in front of what looked like a dead-empty bar. I saw a guy standing next to a door so I went up to him and asked hesitantly, "Is this the... uh..." \n It dawned on me that this guy was not the bouncer. \n "Are you the door guy?" \n "No, but what\'s your question?" \n "Is this where the band is playing?" I blanked on the name, but looking into the door I saw some people standing around and a stage with some guys setting up (taking down, in retrospect). \n He pointed at the paper poster that looked like it had been printed at home and said something I didn\'t quite catch. I proceeded into the venue and showed my id and vaccination card to the real bouncer and then my ticket to the nice lady behind the counter. I made my way to the bar and waited in the short line to get a drink (mango whiteclaw because I couldn\'t betray  myfitnesspal ). \n The guy in front of me asked the bartender for ear plugs. I was kinda surprised. Not sure I heard him right, I asked him if that\'s what he bought. "Yeah", he said. So I bought some as well cuz I\'m not getting any younger. \n I walked around the bar area where alcohol was allowed and nursed my drink, not having much else to do.  The bar  itself was pretty cool. It was an intimately small venue but since it wasn\'t very crowded, it felt pretty roomy. The lighting was cool too, almost more befitting of a nightclub than the venues I was used to. Honestly, I think it\'s my favorite spot I\'ve been to so far. \n Finally, the band started playing! I ditched my drink and joined the small crowd to rock out. \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n It was a good time. Once the show was over, I filed out with some folk to the merch table. I jumped in line behind one other person and waited my turn. \n "Did you make that?" \n I looked over to see who said that. This guy was looking at my jacket (you see what I did there?) so I smiled and rolled down my sleeves, which I\'d pushed up because rocking is hot work. \n "Nah, dude! Thrasher x Supreme collab!" I said, showing him the Supreme logo hidden amidst the patches. "I wasn\'t really sold on it until I saw this  photo  and then I copped one. I was kinda surprised they still had em!" \n I recognized him from walking around the bar earlier. He had a cool hat on with a logo I didn\'t recognize. Looking to return the compliment, I said, "Nice hat!" \n "Thanks!" \n "What is it?" \n " Cult . It\'s a BMX group from California." \n I thought that was pretty fucking rad. \n It was my turn for the goods, so I asked for the  The Shadow I Remember  cassette. She indicated that I would have to get in the  other  line, which is when I realized there were, in fact, two lines, and I was standing in the wrong one. \n Looking over my shoulder, the line was much longer now. Standing awkwardly at the front of the line I didn\'t want to be in, I asked the guy next in line for the Cloud Nothings merch if he\'d mind if I got in front or behind him. He kinda mumbled something and looked uncomfortable but I was still just standing there waiting for an answer. Thankfully, the Cult guy came to my rescue and let me cut in front of him. \n Thanks guy. \n We chatted about shows and the band and I told him I only really knew their first album (I forgot that was their second) and hadn\'t listened to much of their other stuff. He wanted to know what most of the stuff they played tonight was from and I could only offer that I knew the last two songs they played were off of the one album I knew:  Attack on Memory . \n By this time I was at the front of the line and the lead singer (Dylan, I learned) was behind the table. I introduced myself as a long-time fan and re-hashed my explanation of how I listened to their first (second) album and knew that this new album they were touring for was related to it, so that was cool. I got a cassette and having seen "ZINE" on the price list, inquired about it. \n Sure enough, they had one but for some reason it wasn\'t out on the table. My  twin sis  collects zines and I always try to grab one on the rare occasion I come across one for her. This one will be her Christmas present this year (spoiler if you\'re reading, Tina!). \n I also saw he had a sharpie out, so like an idiot, I asked, "Are you signing stuff?" \n "Sure." \n "Well in that case, I\'ll grab one of these." Guess what I pointed at. "I have it already but I\'d love a signed copy." \n I peeled off the plastic and noticed the sticker had a quote from Pitchfork. \n \n \n For too long, indie bands didn\'t want tot get their hands dirty; with  Attack on Memory , Cloud Nothings were out for blood. \n \n \n-PITCHFORK \nBest Albums 2012\n \n \n TJ, as I met, was also behind the table and he signed the album too. I thanked them and told them how I spin their album all the time so I was really grateful to have a signed copy. I was happy. \n It was a good fucking night. \n \n \n \n'},{title:"My Values",frontmatter:{title:"My Values",date:"2021-12-18T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Where I take a good hard look at myself.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"wip",tags:["Goals","Reflections"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Wittman_Estes_Pogue_Hood_Cliff_001.0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"My Values"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Where I take a good hard look at myself."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Wittman_Estes_Pogue_Hood_Cliff_001.0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/12/18/Values.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"My Values"},{property:"og:description",content:"Where I take a good hard look at myself."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Wittman_Estes_Pogue_Hood_Cliff_001.0.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/12/18/Values.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-12-18T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Goals"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{itemprop:"name",content:"My Values"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Where I take a good hard look at myself."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Wittman_Estes_Pogue_Hood_Cliff_001.0.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/12/18/Values.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/12/18/Values.md",key:"v-7a877862",path:"/blog/2021/12/18/Values.html",lastUpdated:"2/28/2022, 11:36:06 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1646109366e3,content:' {{ $page.title }} \n \n I\'ve been thinking a lot about my values.

It has jumped in value 71% in the last month at the time of this writing. Based on my rough calculations, at the rate it's value is increasing, I simply will not be able to accumulate 1 full bitcoin by the end of the year. As the price continues to go up, each monthly purchase I make to acquire more bitcoin will result in smaller and smaller satoshis stacked. \n Therefore, I need to realistically readjust my goal. I can either adjust the timeline or adjust the bitcoin amount. \n However, as I was doing these calculations, something else dawned on me: I really want the  Cybertruck . \n It's quite literally my dream car. I mean I've literally had dreams about owning the Cybertruck. \n The good news is Tesla is planning on  accepting bitcoin as payment . The bad news is that this somewhat conflicts with my goal of accumulating bitcoin. \n If I put all the money I'm saving towards bitcoin as a down payment for the Cybertruck, I should be able to get an auto loan to cover the rest of the cost. This is assuming I bring my credit score up a bit. I've already looked into solutions on how to quickly improve my credit score. First, I'm paying off any small debts that appear on my credit score. Then, I'm also planning on starting to use my  secured credit card  to make small purchases throughout the month that I'll pay back immediately. This will show that I've been using my credit responsibly and should serve to quickly raise my credit. \n There's a few problems with this plan, however. Not only would having an auto payment increase my monthly expense burden, it would also only add to the debt that I'm in. Most of my net worth is tied to the student debt loan I acquired over the span of my 8 year college undergraduate degree. \n The main underlying goal to accumulate bitcoin is to improve my net worth. Taking out an auto loan would severely set back this plan. With all that considered, I still really want the Cybertruck. I'm still debating on if it's worth going further into debt for, but I fear the responsible answer is  no . \n Space Pirates \n My second goal of developing a working prototype of the game is going pretty well, I suppose. I recently acquired the domain name for the website, but I'm still working on another article to anayze the different blockchain options I have for building the game with. I'll be honest and admit it's caused a bit of analysis paralysis. \n I started reading Cal Newport's  Deep Work , and I think if I focus and put in the  deep work , I should be able to quickly wrap up my blockchain analysis article and continue working on the game. I think it's worth analyzing all my options, despite the time it's taking me to do so. \n Fitness \n Finally, I realized that my last two goals to lose 30 lbs and to take up kiteboarding are both related to my fitness. \n I finally bought a bathroom scale so that I could determine my starting weight with which to evaluate my progress towards my goal. I calculate that I should lose about 2-3 lbs per month if I am to reach my goal by the end of the year. I've been seeing one of my best friend's weight loss progress on social media lately and his gains have inspired me to push myself to accomplishing my goal. When I talked to him, he said it's definitely not easy but that it is easier since he's devoting all his attention to doing so. \n I've decided that I'm going to devote all my attention to accomplishing my goals, especially my fitness ones, so I started going to the gym more often. \n I'm very out of shape. \n I realized there's no way I'd be able to keep up with a physically demanding sport like kiteboarding like this, so I really need to focus to get as fit as I can before summer, when I plan to take up kiteboarding lessons. \n Conclusion \n Overall, I think I'm making pretty good progress on my goals. Reading  Deep Work , I realize that I haven't really being doing a whole lot of that lately, especially at work. I realized that when I was doing  deep work  at the start of the year, I wrote about 24 articles on my blog in the span of a month. That's really good work and a testament to what I can accomplish when I focus and really dedicate long hours to uninterrupted work. \n In an effort to maximize my work ethic and achieve my goals, my plan today is to write two articles among other things. This will serve as proof to myself that I can accomplish my goals if I practice doing  deep work . \n P.S.  Utterly focused, I wrote this ~900 word blog post in about an hour.  Most professional writers average about one thousand words per hour , so I already feel pretty good about my level of productivity today! \n \n \n"},{title:"Look - Sébastien Tellier",frontmatter:{title:"Look - Sébastien Tellier",date:"2021-02-21T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A case study on the animated music video for Look by Sébastien Tellier.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8jL0vy2YaDg/0.jpg",type:"post",tags:["Case Study","Music"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8jL0vy2YaDg/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Look - Sébastien Tellier"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A case study on the animated music video for Look by Sébastien Tellier."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8jL0vy2YaDg/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/2/21/Look-Sebastien-Tellier.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Look - Sébastien Tellier"},{property:"og:description",content:"A case study on the animated music video for Look by Sébastien Tellier."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8jL0vy2YaDg/0.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/2/21/Look-Sebastien-Tellier.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-02-21T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Case Study"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Music"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Look - Sébastien Tellier"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A case study on the animated music video for Look by Sébastien Tellier."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8jL0vy2YaDg/0.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/2/21/Look-Sebastien-Tellier.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/2/21/Look-Sebastien-Tellier.md",key:"v-574f7f36",path:"/blog/2021/2/21/Look-Sebastien-Tellier.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Background",slug:"background"},{level:2,title:"Thoughts",slug:"thoughts"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Background \n ASS. \n Yes, we all know why we're here. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's take a more examined look at the subtleties that make this music video so great. \n Since I got a Google TV, rather than just playing Spotify on the TV, I've taken a liking to playing music via YouTube Music to have a complete audio-visual experience. Most of the music I'll listen to is electronic dance music, so it's not unsurprising that I stumbled on this video. I obviously clicked on it based on the thumbnail. \n However, looking at the artist on Spotify, I was surprised to find this was not my first introduction to the artist. I liked the song  La ritournelle (Gilligan Moss Mix)  as early as 2018 (and thanks to duplicate songs, again in 2019). \n \n The song  Look  in the music video was relased as part of the aptly named  Sexuality  album in 2008. I like the imagery of the cowboy riding on the woman's body as it reminds me of a more poetic version of the same scene in  Your Rocky Spine  by the Great Lake Swimmers. \n Thoughts \n Unlike most of my other case studies I've done on music, the focus of this article will be on the animation and the music video as a whole, rather than on the song itself. As such, I won't be focusing on the lyrics at all but offer more of a guided tour narrating my thoughts during the music video. \n To begin, we see a simple outline approximating the shape of a pair of short shorts, stretched tightly across a  fine  booty. \n Black on white. It's simple and alluring. Nothing except the swaying motion of a young womans hips as she goes on her merry way, destination unknown. More lines appear and form the rest of body-- hands, hair and thighs swaying along with the butt to completing the picture. \n It's worth pointing out how smooth this simple anmiation which persists throughout the entire video really is. Although the lines appear to be hand drawn, it's very likely that the animation was captured with  rotoscoping . \n \n   \n \n Eventually, her shorts begin to slowly dissolve away until they're nothing more than a revealing layer of black webbing. With a casual motion of the wrist, she pulls off the remants of the shorts and flicks it away, leaving her walking bare-ass naked before us. \n A dazzle of light reflects between her thigh-gap, highlighting this glorious space. \n Then, almost comically, we see a small puff escape between this gap, like a small toot. It's almost funny how this cloud dissipates as rare jewels drifting in the breeze. \n She comes across field of thick, cartoon-like grass. Her hands brush against this grass and her pace slows down a bit. Perhaps she's taking pause to enjoy this sensation. \n Like a dream, the grass rises up and away as she resumes her strut to the pace of the music. Black ink begins to wrap around her thighs, down her back and around her arms. This ink slowly expands and begins to resemble latex garments. The black latex slowly consumes the view of her butt, leaving a shrinking hole in the back until it she is completely covered by the material. It's explicitly sexy in a way her short shorts and even her naked form before were not. \n Now, the motion of her hips is not only defined by the outline of her shape, but by the light reflected off the latex material. This light cleverly begins to swirl before assuming the shape of her skeleton. The hip bones, the coccyx and the femur all swaying in unison to the motion we were previously so captivated by. Now, we see the underlying structure that provides the function of the motion. It's not sexy in the same way it was when it was plump flesh bouncing to this motion, but the motion is certainly still captivating, curiously. \n The black latex material further expands to consume the rest of the environment. Now it's just the internal form of the girl, almost as if we are no longer observing  her , but rather walking in her shoes, so to sepak, and experiencing her point of view as she continues down her pedestrian journey. \n White clouds waft into view, passing through her hip bones like a scents through a nostril. Maybe this is how she experiences the world, as an assortment of aromas drifting through the air. It almost alludes to the comical \"fart\" cloud earlier. \n Her form returns and the white clouds thicken, like a steamy mist. A white outline rises as she walks to conceal her form like water in a bath. Plunging below this water line, we see her shape again, the lines distored as squiggles. \n Settling into this underwater view, we see bubbles float past her as she walks, almost like a fizzy beverage. Black lines swim past her like fish in a river or... well, like sperm, frankly. \n Bubbles continue to fizz around her, like a freshly opened carbonated drink. Then, like acid, more bubbles appear until holes begin appearing on her body and she starts to dissolve away. She continues to shrink away until there is nothing left of her, like the last bubble of a champagne glass drifting away before going flat. \n \n \n"},{title:"Time",frontmatter:{title:"Time",date:"2021-03-14T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Reflections on the temporal axis.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uD4izuDMUQA/0.jpg",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Definitions"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uD4izuDMUQA/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Time"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Reflections on the temporal axis."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uD4izuDMUQA/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/3/14/Time.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Time"},{property:"og:description",content:"Reflections on the temporal axis."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uD4izuDMUQA/0.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/3/14/Time.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Definitions"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Time"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Reflections on the temporal axis."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uD4izuDMUQA/0.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/3/14/Time.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/3/14/Time.md",key:"v-3e580436",path:"/blog/2021/3/14/Time.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"The Calendar",slug:"the-calendar"},{level:2,title:"A superior calendar",slug:"a-superior-calendar"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n   \n \n I think I've always respected the significance time in my life. \n Growing up with what I considered a limited memory, I felt the power time had in my life to sweep away insignificant details. The older I grew, the more details faded from my fallible memory. In the wake of time I found only products of high quality remained, especially in my perceived physical reality. \n This highlighted the importance of  quality  to me, not only in physical properties, but also in the careful mental craft of  planning  for the future. Indeed, as it is from these plans that most physical products of exceptional quality are manifested into your reality. \n For example, when I was freshman in college in 2011, after receiving my tuition reimbursement money, I went to my local Best Buy and bought a good quality, brand new acoustic guitar. Music was always a passion of mine and I no longer had access to my cousin's old guitar I practiced on. I figured a brand new one would be a good investment that I hoped would last me a long time. And it did! A full decade later and I still own and play that same guitar. \n My point is that I've had many possessions over the course of said decade but a lot has happened during those ten years; I moved about six times and my inventory of possessions grew and shrank each time. At the end, the few items that survived each move all had their quality and significance to me in common. Usually, these items would gain  more  significance to me as time passed. \n One of these items was a book my friend gave me called  365 Tao: Daily Meditations . I always attributed noticing patterns as a strength of mine, particularly in nature, and I found many of the meditations from the book showed how nature's wisdom could be applied to other aspects of life. \n One of these patterns is cycles. \n When viewing the dazzling breadth of organic noise against the constant backdrop of time, nature's cycles become obvious. Indeed, her cycles are cosmic in scale when compared to the unstoppable force of time; the moon revolves around the Earth and the Earth revolves around the Sun. \n And so, naturally, we use natures cycles to measure time. A full rotation of the Earth is a day; the complete orbit of the Earth is a year! \n Solar Time.  😎 \n The Calendar \n So this relative definition of time works for us as citizens of the Earth. We live our lives largely focused on the daily cycle. \n But as I was unfortunately privy to, the mind's memory is woefully short. A single day is not so bad, but a lot can happen in a year. Something built in a day will hardly last a year. \n So maybe we need an intermediate measurement between a day and a year so that we may build something to last our orbit around the sun. \n Alas, the phases of the moon! Indeed, we can use their intervals to divide the chasm of the year. \n But, although natural, the position and size of our heavenly bodies are somewhat arbitrary, resulting in an  approximate  measurement; about 12 months, to be exact. \n This approximation, however, results in small rounding errors as we synchronize our daily times to these monthly subdivisions (much to the chagrin of mathematicians everywhere). \n Fuck it!  Daylight Savings Time , said George Hudson. \n And so, humanity successfully standardized the calendar. Except  some calendars  couldn't quite agree on the number of days in a month or even how to further subdivide the month. \n Somehow , we decided on 7 days a week, with 4 of those bad boys in a month. \n Approximately. \n Regardless, we created  Universal Time  and coordinated with the rest of the Earth citizens to create  Coordinated Universal Time . \n Hooray! Maybe  Sky Daddy  will love us now? \n A superior calendar \n But perhaps we can yet improve upon this calendar. \n Behold, the  International Fixed Calendar , presented to you in an easily digestible format. \n \n I'm still hoping it catches on. \n \n \n"},{title:"Granolah, The Survivor",frontmatter:{title:"Granolah, The Survivor",date:"2021-01-21T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A hype piece on the new Dragon Ball Super manga arc.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Comics","Manga","Dragon Ball Super","Hype"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/dbs68.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Granolah, The Survivor"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A hype piece on the new Dragon Ball Super manga arc."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/dbs68.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/21/Granolah-The-Survivor.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Granolah, The Survivor"},{property:"og:description",content:"A hype piece on the new Dragon Ball Super manga arc."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/dbs68.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/21/Granolah-The-Survivor.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-21T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Comics"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Manga"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Dragon Ball Super"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Hype"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Granolah, The Survivor"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A hype piece on the new Dragon Ball Super manga arc."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/dbs68.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/21/Granolah-The-Survivor.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/21/Granolah-The-Survivor.md",key:"v-5d47c7a5",path:"/blog/2021/1/21/Granolah-The-Survivor.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n In addition to  Joe's inauguration , yesterday was an important day because the new chapter of  Dragon Ball Super  came out! \n And let me tell ya, I haven't been this hyped for Dragon Ball since the start of the  Moro arc . \n That arc, called the Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga, suggested the development of the Dragon Ball universe as a proper sci-fi fantasy universe. It introduced us to the  Galactic King , ruler of Universe 7 and leader of the Galactic Patrol. We started to see the scope of Dragon Ball retract a little as the story shifted focus from a cosmic scale and focus on the galactic scale. This, I think, is healthy for the franchise as  power creep  has been a serious concern of many fans as the story has progressed. \n Toriyama and Toyotaro started to flesh out the galaxy with the introduction of new species other than Saiyans, new planets beyond Vegeta, and forces in the galaxy to oppose the Freeza Force. In the midst of the Moro arc, we saw Vegeta take a spaceship to  Yardrat  to learn of a new technique to hopefully stop the villain. Eventually, however, the story devolved into disappointment as Moro literally turned into a planet at the end. No less bizarre than Cell turning himself into a fat bomb, I guess. \n With the end of the Moro arc, chapter 68 begins the next arc: Granolah, The Survivor Saga. \n \n This motherfucker don't play around. \n Granolah  is the sole survivor of the Cerealian race, annihilated by the Saiyan Army, leading him to seek revenge against Freeza. He wears a buckled leather eyepatch and is accompanied by his acquaintance, Oatmeel. (You'll quickly notice the breakfast puns.) \n What's interesting about his race of cereal people being destroyed is in the flashback, we see one particular great ape hunting Granolah. As some of the fans have pointed out, the scar on this ape's face is identical to  Bardock's . This has led to speculation that he'll recognize Goku as his father's son, connecting his plot to the main characters. \n \n At the end of the last arc, we see Granolah track down a spaceship, board it, and recover android OG73-i. Seven Three is unique because he can copy up to three abilities from others; a powerful tool against powerful enemies, of which there are many in the Dragon Ball universe. \n \n \n As we learn in the latest chapter, Granolah is a bounty hunter for  Elec , who unlike previous antagonist characters in Dragon Ball, is cunning, careful, and manipulative. \n I thought this guy would be scuffed Bojack but he's actually a smart, calculative character that actually uses strategy and is looking for dominance over Freeza. It's such a different type of antagonist for Dragon Ball i can't help to be super interested, even if he's a pushover  pic.twitter.com/8AtV9q9d6X — Phoebe (@tfwPhoebe)  January 20, 2021   \n After he collects his hefty bounty prize from Elec, he's ambushed in space by a fellow bounty hunter looking to lift the reward off him. They land on an asteroid where Granolah outmaneuvers them and snipes them all with a stun gun. \n What I love about this scene is that it occurs wholly removed from the vicinity of the main cast. It is a tale from the fringes of the galaxy, and it has the same gritty appeal of Star Wars, from the bounty hunters and different alien races, to the stun guns and lone spaceships. The whole theme of a small crew making their way through the galaxy is reminiscent of  Cowboy Bebop , and it's the same vibe I want to capture in my  Space Pirates  game. \n Something I noticed in the latest chapter: Goku and Whis share qualities that make Ultra Instinct suit them. Interestingly Beerus' fighting style might suit Vegeta more.  This compatibility between Whis & Goku and Beerus & Vegeta is also shown through the speech bubble shapes.  pic.twitter.com/rYyiZl6Chi — Totally Not Mark (@TotallyNotMark)  January 20, 2021   \n Meanwhile, on Beerus's planet, Goku is continuing his  Ultra Instinct  training while Vegeta watches. The last arc provided some very interesting character development for Vegeta, although they still snubbed him of the limelight as Goku ultimately defeated Moro. \n Once again, however, Toriyama and Toyotaro hint at another avenue for Vegeta to surpass Goku by his own rights, this time with Beerus, God of Destruction, as his mentor. Very exciting developments, indeed. \n \n Overall, this new chapter lays out the groundwork for a potentially very interesting story arc in Universe 7. \n \n You can read Dragon Ball Super Chapter 68 for free  here . \n \n \n"},{title:"Cajun Chicken Parmesan Penne",frontmatter:{title:"Cajun Chicken Parmesan Penne",date:"2021-03-28T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A recipe for Crockpot Cajun Chicken Alfredo.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Fyrpy3b9q74/0.jpg",type:"post",tags:["Recipes"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Fyrpy3b9q74/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Cajun Chicken Parmesan Penne"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A recipe for Crockpot Cajun Chicken Alfredo."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Fyrpy3b9q74/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/3/28/Cajun-Chicken-Parmesan-Penne.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Cajun Chicken Parmesan Penne"},{property:"og:description",content:"A recipe for Crockpot Cajun Chicken Alfredo."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Fyrpy3b9q74/0.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/3/28/Cajun-Chicken-Parmesan-Penne.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-03-28T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Recipes"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Cajun Chicken Parmesan Penne"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A recipe for Crockpot Cajun Chicken Alfredo."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Fyrpy3b9q74/0.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/3/28/Cajun-Chicken-Parmesan-Penne.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/3/28/Cajun-Chicken-Parmesan-Penne.md",key:"v-f66f59b6",path:"/blog/2021/3/28/Cajun-Chicken-Parmesan-Penne.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Jump to Recipe",slug:"jump-to-recipe"},{level:2,title:"Background",slug:"background"},{level:2,title:"Recipe",slug:"recipe"},{level:2,title:"Ingredients",slug:"ingredients"},{level:2,title:"Instructions",slug:"instructions"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n  Jump to Recipe \n Background \n For my birthday this month, like any responsible adult, I bought myself some kitchen appliances. This included a Crockpot, which I bought immediately as soon as I realized you could cook things other than soup in them, like pasta! \n I stumbled upon this recipe on YouTube and it looked so good I had to try it myself. \n The recipe calls for  Creole Kick  seasoning, which I substituted for some  Old Bay  seasoning. Feel free to include your own Cajun spices. \n I had to write down all the ingredients from the video before I went shopping and then kept watching the video again while I made the meal to see the instructions, so I've decided to write down the recipe on my blog for convenience. \n Recipe \n 8 servings. 20-30 minute prep time. \n Ingredients \n 1   tbs     olive oil\n1.5 lb      chicken breasts\n1   lb      chicken andouille sausage \n3   cups    heavy cream\n4   cups    chicken broth\n4   tbs     butter\n2   tbs     cajun seasoning\n2   cloves  garlic \n1   lb      uncooked penne pasta\n0.5 cup     hot water\n8   oz      freshly shredded parmesan cheese (~2 1/2 cups)\n            salt\n            black pepper\n            garlic powder\n Instructions \n \n Bring a pan to medium-high heat and drizzle olive oil into the pan.  Sear the chicken  for about 4-5 minutes on each side until brown. Season each side with spices. \n Cut the andouille sausage into slices. \n Add the ingredients to your slow cooker.  Place the chicken at the bottom of the pot, add the sausages and garlic on top. Pour in heavy cream and chicken broth. Add butter as two blocks into the mix. Add more seasoning on top. \n Cook on HIGH for 2.5 hours. \n Remove chicken from slow cooker and cut into pieces. \n Heat up 0.5 cup of water and add to the slow cooker, stirring the mix. \n Add penne pasta to the slow cooker and cook on HIGH for 30 minutes. \n Add chicken back into the pot. \n Shred parmesan cheese and add to mixture while stirring. \n Eat it.

I've been pretty interested in  van-life  as a future lifestyle, but for now I'm comfortably settled into my apartment. \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n In a lot of her videos, she'll talk about her life and her process for building the van she's going to live in, all while eating these delicious looking spring rolls. They look so refreshing and I know for a fact that peanut butter sauce is  bussin . \n So after watching one of her vidoes and realizing you could make them, I was inspired to try them for myself. I've been cooking a lot of Japanese food lately and I figured I'd have most of the ingredients necessary to make them. \n Gỏi cuốn , Vietnamese spring roll, fresh spring roll, spring roll, or rice paper roll, is a Vietnamese dish traditionally consisting of pork, prawn, vegetables, bún, and other ingredients wrapped in Vietnamese bánh tráng. In Japan, they are called nama harumaki (生春巻き, \"raw spring rolls\"), and are typically filled with shrimp. This seems to be the popular form they've taken in the west and it's the recipe I've used that I'm going to share with you. Feel free to get creative and add your own ingredients to the contents of the spring roll, like mango slices or mint leaves. \n Recipe \n 2 servings. 10-15 mins. prep time. \n Ingredients \n Spring Roll \n 2           rice paper wrapper\n8-10        cooked shrimp\n2           lettuce leaves\n60  mL      water\n10  mL      fresh lime juice\n1/4         sliced cucumber\n1/4         sliced carrot\n1/2         sliced red pepper\n1/2         sliced avocado\n15  mL      chopped cilantro\n0.021 tbsp  salt*\n \n *  Precise measurements are  important . \n Peanut Dipping Sauce \n 30  mL      natural peanut butter\n5   mL      hoisin sauce (found in the Asian section of grocery stores)\n5   mL      Sriracha\n5   mL      soy sauce\n10  mL      warm water\n Instructions \n \n Chop and slice your vegetables  before preparing the spring roll. This is important as you'll have a short window to wrap your spring roll befor the rice paper wrapper dries out. For drying out the rice paper, I prefer to use a wooden cutting board but you can also use a paper towel. Just be careful the rice paper doesn't dry to the paper towel. \n Fill a plate with water and place the rice paper wrapper on the plate.  Make sure the water covers the wrapper completely and let it soak for  20-30  seconds until the rice paper is pliable. \n Place the rice paper on a dry surface. \n Place the contents of the spring roll inside the wrap.  This includes all of your vegetables and the shrimp. \n Squeeze the fresh lime juice onto the wrap and add salt. \n Wrap the spring roll like a burrito. \n Mix the ingredients of the Peanut Dipping Sauce together.  Use the water as necessary to thin the peanut sauce to the desired consistency. \n Eat it. \n \n Update:  I'm still trying to figure out the secret to wrapping them  tightly . This is critical to making a perfect wrap. I've found varying success in placing the moist rice paper on top of the prepared contents of the wrap, and going from there. You're mileage may vary. \n \n \n \n"},{title:"Backpacking Trip With Carlos",frontmatter:{title:"Backpacking Trip With Carlos",date:"2021-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",description:"My vacation I took backpacking with Carlos on the Appalachian Trail.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Memories"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/viewswithcarlos.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Backpacking Trip With Carlos"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"My vacation I took backpacking with Carlos on the Appalachian Trail."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/viewswithcarlos.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/5/30/Backpacking-Trip-With-Carlos.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Backpacking Trip With Carlos"},{property:"og:description",content:"My vacation I took backpacking with Carlos on the Appalachian Trail."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/viewswithcarlos.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/5/30/Backpacking-Trip-With-Carlos.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-05-30T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Backpacking Trip With Carlos"},{itemprop:"description",content:"My vacation I took backpacking with Carlos on the Appalachian Trail."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/viewswithcarlos.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/5/30/Backpacking-Trip-With-Carlos.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/5/30/Backpacking-Trip-With-Carlos.md",key:"v-6017abf6",path:"/blog/2021/5/30/Backpacking-Trip-With-Carlos.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"The Trip",slug:"the-trip"},{level:3,title:"Day 1",slug:"day-1"},{level:3,title:"Day 2",slug:"day-2"},{level:3,title:"Day 3",slug:"day-3"},{level:3,title:"Day 4",slug:"day-4"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n Henry  died on Tuesday, May 18th. \n He was a good boy and lived a happy little life. He was in his fifth  instar  when I bought him and molted once when I had him, so he lived a long and healthy life. I buried him next to a tree in front of my apartment. \n Friday was the last day of work before I went on vacation. As soon as I got off work, I put on my hiking boots and went outside. I had planned a backpacking trip with my brother for which I had taken the week before Memorial day off for. In order to prepare for the hike, I began walking around the lake near my place in my new hiking boots to break them in. It was roughly 4 miles. \n Towards the end of the walk, there is a bridge that crosses a part of the lake. This time, I stopped at the bridge and sat on one of the benches that was built into it. I admired the beauty of the sunset. \n When I finished my walk and got home, I hopped in the shower, missing my brothers call. Afterwards, I called him back to finalize some of the details about our backpacking trip. We wanted to do a 3-day backpacking trip in the mountains somewhere nearby and settled on  Fires Creek Rim Trail  since it was close and was about the length we wanted for a 3-day trip. \n We were both very excited about it. I told him I planned on driving over to his place in South Carolina on Saturday. There's an REI in Columbia that we planned to get most of our gear from before heading out the next day. I was skeptical about getting all of our shopping done on Saturday, packing and then driving up to start hiking Sunday, but I told him we'll work out the details when I get to his place on Saturday; that was the first step. \n Before we ended the call, I told him about Henry. He was sorry and pointed out that he was my first real pet and I realized he was right. Henry was special to me because he was truly my first pet. \n We ended the call and I went to the couch to watch TV. I had been thinking about the  Space Pirates  game a lot, especially how I wanted to incorporate different dimensions into it. Somehow I stumbled on  Kurzgesagt's  video called  The Egg . It really resonated with me. \n \n   \n \n I started going down a rabbit hole of YouTube videos which included learning about  the largest star in the Universe ,  incredibly optimum movement mechanics in Apex Legends  and a  weirdly awkward interview , all of which (at the time) seemed to somehow feed into my idea that we may, in fact, be  living in a simulation . \n I won't try to explain my thought process here. \n Regardless, I didn't end up getting any sleep that night. By 9, I pulled out my backpack from the closet and started packing it with clothes and supplies for the trip. \n It took me about 3 hours to drive to Columbia and when I got there, my mom was at Carlos' place and he had just woken up. We then drove to REI to do some shopping. On the way, we talked about maybe doing a different trail since the elevation on the one we had decided on before seemed kinda steep. Either way, we also agreed we should rest Sunday and drive up early Monday morning. \n When we got to the store, I had a few things on my shopping list with a budget of about $300. \n Hammock tarp\nDehydrated food\nBear sack\nBackpacking stove\nBladder\nWater Filter\nBackpacking chair\nCarabiner\nTrekking poles\n \n It came out to around $600. Carlos also bought a new backpack among other supplies, so we were both over budget. \n Naturally, we decided to play poker that night. \n We went to a local cash game and I bought in for $100. I had some pretty bad luck throughout the night, but my bad play was mostly attributed to the fact that I was running on fumes at that point. Since I hadn't slept the night before and it was my first time playing with this group, I couldn't get a good read on anyone and ended down by the end of the night. I still had fun, tho. \n When we got home, I passed out. \n The next day we went to Academy to get some clothes and socks mostly for the trip. We planned to carbo-load that night with some pasta from Olive Garden, but Carlos got invited to another cash game (they had a spot open up) so he decided to go play instead. \n I went with mom to dine in at Olive Garden and ordered a takeout meal for Carlos. We talked about a lot of things including her relationship with her mother and I asked her about her dad, something I had often wondered about. I knew he died when my mom was 16 and I once heard my grandma tell me that I reminder her a lot of him. \n Apparently, my grandfather was a workaholic, having been raised on a farm, so my mom never actually got to spend a lot of time with him. He was also very artistic and kept a sketchbook of faces and hands, if I recall correctly. I do remember my grandma telling me that he was always attracted to art and in that regard I can relate to him. \n We went home and I continued watching some more YouTube videos to feed my growing obsession with understanding the universe. Carlos came home while we finished up watching an  explanation of the 10 dimensions  (according to string theory). \n I fell asleep that night dreaming of how I could create dimensional mechanics in my  Space Pirates  game. \n The Trip \n Finally, Monday morning came. We decided the day before that we would end up doing the  Kimsey Creek to Long Branch Loop  in the Nantahala National Forest. \n \n The elevation was easier and it was long enough it would take us about 3 days to complete. We parked the car and began hiking. \n Day 1 \n We were surrounded by a beautiful green forest most of the time. Right away I realized this was going to be better than I realized, but also harder than I realized. Most of the elevation we were to climb was going to be on the first day and I'm glad we ended up going for this trail because I was not prepared for how hard hiking up hill with a 48 lb backpack would be. \n Along the way, passed by a few other hikers. One of them was an elder man who seemed to be familiar with this trail. We asked him about how much water we should be carrying and he told us not to worry about it as there is plenty of water along the trail. He laughed when we told him we were carrying 7 liters of water. To be fair, we expected we'd have to carry most of our water along the hike. While he told us he wouldn't recommend dumping water, he assured us there were plenty of spots for water. \n With that being said, we decided to dump some of our water further along the trail. I dumped my extra 2.5 liter bladder and Carlos dumped his extra bladder as well as his water bottles. \n We stopped for lunch at a clearing and I got to use my  mini stove  to boil water for our dehydrated food. It worked great! \n Eventually, we came onto the  Appalachian Trail . This trail was much more worn and maintained. \n We came across our first shelter just before the peak of Albert Mountain. There was a big creek nearby with a sign that read WATER. We rested at the shelter and there were a few other hikers who were planning to spend the night there after having hiked 12 miles or so that day. \n Carlos prompted me to continue up the mountain to get to the peak and I reluctantly agreed. We still had plenty of time left in the day to make it and we wanted to make that checkpoint in our journey in order to maintain the pace needed to finish on time. \n We kept hiking up the mountain. \n This was one of the hardest parts of the trip. The trek to the top of the mountain was steep and I kept having to stop to let my feet rest, catch my breath and drink some water. It was exhausting. \n Thankfully, Carlos offered to carry my bag up the rest of the way since I was struggling to keep up the pace. He and Harley (his dog) went up the mountain as I followed with nothing but my trekking poles. \n As I was resting near the top, Carlos and Harley came back, leaving the packs at the peak. I was nearly at the top already! \n I was really impressed when I reached the top. There were a number of hikers already setting up camp near the base of the fire tower that was there. It overlooked a beautiful view of the mountain ranges. Someone at the top of the fire towered called down to the rest of us that the sun was setting and we should get a look at it. \n Despite my tired feet, I climbed up the tower with everyone else to get an amazing view of the sun set. It was a bold red sun, giving the clouds a smoky grey color. It was beautiful. \n We set up our hammocks between some trees nearby and I began cooking dinner for us. The dehydrated meals were actually very delicious and just what we needed to recover our energy after a hard climb to the top. \n That night was very cold and since I sleep on my belly, it was hard for me to sleep in a hammock. I got hardly any sleep. \n Day 2 \n So it turned out, we were fresh out of water. We should have stopped to refill when we had the chance a the shelter before reaching Albert's peak, but for some reason, Carlos expected there to be some kind of spigot for water at the fire tower. I don't think he realized most of our water would be coming from natural water sources on the mountain. \n Regardless, it was also my fault for not refilling earlier as well. I overheard some of the other hikers who were in our similar predicament mention that they'd stop for breakfast at the first water source they found and I thought that sounded like an excellent idea. \n We headed down the south side of Albert Mountain and it was STEEP. It was here I was especially grateful for our trekking poles as it seemed like the only thing keeping me from rolling freely down the mountain. \n The first water source we came by was thin streams of water dripping off of a mossy cliff face. Carlos passed it by, not even considering it as a water source, but I figured it was running and if we were patient enough we could filter our squeeze pouches with it. \n Indeed, it was slow going, but we managed to fill up some of our water bottles with the pouches. Harley lapped up some of the muddy water beneath it, despite offering her her bowl with freshly filtered water. \n \n The water we gathered was enough to get us to the next campsite which was next to a nice little river. We stopped there along with some of the other hikers we had met at the fire tower for breakfast. I took my shoes off and went barefoot, dipping my feet into the cold stream a little bit. I had already acquired blisters on my pinky toes. \n Camped at the river was an elderly couple. The older gentleman said he had hiked this trail at least 12 times. They were camped there as chaperones for about 5 group of seniors who were hiking the same loop we were (only in the opposite direction). They were parked close by and offered to take our trash, which we gratefully accepted. \n We then continued on to the next checkpoint. Judging by our (read: my) pace, we decided we could take an extra day to finish the trail. This would let us reach the second peak on Wednesday, camp there, and then quickly make our way all downhill Thursday. We took inventory and decided if we skipped lunch today (we had a late breakfast anyway), we could have enough meals for dinner and breakfast on the last day. \n After a while of hiking, we came across an opening that gave a stunning view of the valley. I told Carlos I wanted to take a nap here so we decided to set up our hammocks for a bit. I passed out immediately. \n \n When Carlos woke me up, 2 hours had passed. Apparently, he had been on the phone with mom and then nodded off. Feeling somewhat rested, we packed up and hurried along our way. \n The next checkpoint we arrived at was another shelter with a water source close by. I gratefully (and exhaustedly) collapsed inside, my blistered feet throbbing. \n Camped there were two girls, one of which had started a fire already. One of them had a little dog tied up to a tree by a very long rope. \n After some small talk we introduced ourselves. Katie was the one with the dog and Amanda was the other one. Apparently, Amanda had some experience hiking the A.T. and had a book which marked many of the campsites that we didn't know about from the All Trails app Carlos was using. \n We had a good time chatting around the fire and eating dinner. I quickly went to bed after it got dark and everyone else followed suit. I opted to sleep in the shelter so that I could sleep on my belly. \n I slept like a rock. \n Day 3 \n In the morning we cleaned up, made breakfast and fetched some water by the stream. There was a privy nearby which I took advantage of, although to be honest, I still rather enjoyed squatting out in nature like a savage. \n Carlos mentioned that Amanda was asking if we had an extra lighter. Luckily I did keep a spare lighter in my backpack, so I offered it to her. She was thrilled because she was worried about running out of lighter fuel along the way. I was happy to help and told her not to worry about it, since worse case I could use my flint and steel. She said she was also glad she would have something to remember us by now and it felt good to know we would be part of her memory of the trail. \n We said our goodbyes and headed out. \n I would say that this day was the hardest. It was more elevation and by the time we neared the peak, I was exhausted, dehydrated and out of water. \n I had packed walkie-talkies for the trip (which Carlos had got me after he lost one I brought with us to  Okeechobee ) and Carlos decided we should turn them on so that we could stay in communication while he went at his own pace ahead of me. He told me to radio him whenever I took a break then continued up the mountain. \n I radioed him the first time I took a break and he acknowledged me. The second time I paused, I didn't hear a reply. I looked down and realized my walkie-talkie was dead. \n Oof. \n I made my way slowly up the mountain, not really sure how much further I had left to go. I kept taking breaks, but with no water, I wasn't resting so much as I was making it harder for myself. Still, I needed to give my feet a break. \n Finally, I came across a sign at an intersection that said Standing Indian Mt. I turned on the radio and used the last bit of juice it had left in it to call Carlos and ask which way to go. Thankfully, he replied right away that I should turn left and go up the rest of the way to the mountain top. Then the radio died again. \n I saw a campsite just beyond the sign so I decided to set up my hammock there. Carlos came down a few moments later and told me I needed to keep going up to make it to the top. I was satisfied with how far I had made it and was okay with skipping out on the view in favour of resting my feet in the hammock. \n Carlos showed me some pictures of him and Harley at the top of the mountain, and it did look gorgeous. I was happy for him. \n \n While I rested in the hammock, Carlos made me dinner using the last of the water I had left in my Nalgene. He had trouble getting a flame out of the lighter but finally managed to catch a spark on the propane stove. I savoured the hot meal, bundled in my hammock. \n We didn't have any water left tho, but now that I was rested and filled, we decided to go find some. There was a blue trail which I thought someone along the way had mentioned there was water down, but after walking down the trail a bit, Carlos seemed unconvinced. He decided to take the filter and bottles (which I'd attached to the carabiners I bought) and check the other path, down the Appalachian Trail. \n He disappeared going back up the mountain and I was left to realize how far down I had gone. I slowly made my way back up the mountain to our campsite. \n When I got there, I finished setting up my hammock with the rainfly and started working on setting up a fire. It was a good thing I brought my flint and steel because the lighter we had been using was completely empty. \n Carlos and Harley made it back with water and I was very happy they did. We almost immediately used all the water between cooking the rest of the food and drinking it, but we figured we could find some the next day. \n I offered to set up Carlos's rainfly as thanks for finding water. His rainfly was awful, however, and an absolute pain in the ass. \n We had a good rest of the night talking by the fire. There was supposed to be a blood moon in the early hours of the morning that night, but we were probably going to miss it. \n We said our goodnights and went to bed. \n Day 4 \n Finally, today was the day we'd be going home. \n We cooked breakfast and split an extra meal we had somehow not accounted for. We packed up camp, a bit slower than usual, and headed down the mountain. \n Carlos said the blue trail was actually a shortcut back to the parking lot we had arrived at, so I was more than happy to opt for that route. \n It was mostly smooth sailing downhill. We made good pace as we were covered in shade, surrounded by the beautiful green forest. \n We started talking about religion and science which devolved into an argument about how science  can't  prove everything and how Carlos refused to believe in the Big Bang theory because he believed in Creation theory, despite me trying to explain how at some point a long the way between believe in the moon landing and the Big Bang theory, he must stop believing in science. It was a frustrating and circular argument that we eventually had to drop because I was getting frustrated by it. \n Eventually, I ran out of steam and Carlos graciously offered to carry my pack for the rest of the way, reasoning that we'd be able to make it down faster that way. I agreed and we continued our brisk pace down the mountain. \n The trail began to flatten out and we began to find ourselves back in civilization, passing by campsites and cars. We followed a paved road back to the parking lot and back to the comfort of the car. \n Hallelujah! \n Looking back, I still can't believe we (I) made it. It ended up being about 27 miles in total. It was one of the hardest things I've done in my life so far, but also one of the most rewarding experiences. \n Since Carlos drove up and I owed him for so much on the trip, I drove on the way back. \n We stopped by a small town nearby for gas and food. We got chicken sandwiches at Zaxby's. It was amazing. \n We both agreed we would definitely be doing more backpacking trips from now on, especially now that we had one under our belt and plenty of gear and experience for next time. \n \n \n"},{title:"For How Long",frontmatter:{title:"For How Long",date:"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A case study on the song For How Long by Tycho and Saint Sinner.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Case Study","Music"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/weatherbytycho.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"For How Long"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A case study on the song For How Long by Tycho and Saint Sinner."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/weatherbytycho.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/7/11/For-How-Long.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"For How Long"},{property:"og:description",content:"A case study on the song For How Long by Tycho and Saint Sinner."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/weatherbytycho.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/7/11/For-How-Long.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Case Study"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Music"},{itemprop:"name",content:"For How Long"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A case study on the song For How Long by Tycho and Saint Sinner."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/weatherbytycho.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/7/11/For-How-Long.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/7/11/For-How-Long.md",key:"v-25c6ea76",path:"/blog/2021/7/11/For-How-Long.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Release",slug:"release"},{level:2,title:"Discovery",slug:"discovery"},{level:2,title:"Lyrics",slug:"lyrics"}],lastUpdated:"7/11/2021, 5:02:05 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1626037325e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n Release \n For How Long  is the sixth song on  Weather , the fifth studio album by ambient music project Tycho, released on July 12, 2019. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Dance/Electronic Album category. Scott Hansen described the album as a collaboration with Saint Sinner, saying that he \"wanted to finally fulfil what had been a vision of mine since the beginning: to incorporate the most organic instrument of all, the human voice\". \n Discovery \n I think I found this song on my Discover Weekly playlist but I must have really become obsessed with it while listening to my recent liked songs. I absolutely love this song. It's smart and sexy and makes me want to move my hips in dance to the easy beat. \n  Lyrics \n Aside from how sonically beautiful it is, I think the lyrics are what resonated with me. There's a melancholia present in Saint Sinners' tone that I think expresses the bittersweet frustration of unrequited love perfectly. \n \"For how long?\" is the dreaded question asked in an unequal relation where one knows the others love will not last forever. \n Interestingly, tho, this song's lyrics are more about the challenges the singer faces in a polyamorous relationship. Initially, I didn't really think of it so much of a polyamorous relationship as I did more of the singer's responsibility to care for more than just her lover. As I read more into the lyrics, it made more sense to me how it's about polyamory but personally, I still think of it as the singer's struggle to get commitment from a selfish lover. \n \n You don't like to share \n I do \n Oh, I love and care \n For more than one of you \n Can't you see the way I do? \n No? That's okay \n That's cool \n \n \n \n"},{title:"My Mental Health",frontmatter:{title:"My Mental Health",date:"2021-03-24T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A reflection on my mental health.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Memories","Mental Health"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/ACT.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"My Mental Health"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A reflection on my mental health."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/ACT.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/3/24/My-Mental-Health.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"My Mental Health"},{property:"og:description",content:"A reflection on my mental health."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/ACT.jpeg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/3/24/My-Mental-Health.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-03-24T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Memories"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Mental Health"},{itemprop:"name",content:"My Mental Health"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A reflection on my mental health."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/ACT.jpeg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/3/24/My-Mental-Health.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/3/24/My-Mental-Health.md",key:"v-99cea476",path:"/blog/2021/3/24/My-Mental-Health.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Episode 1",slug:"episode-1"}],lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n Today is my birthday. I  try not to notice  them, but this one is significant to me because it marks 1 year since my 27th birthday, which I spent descending into madness inside a behavioral hospital. 10 years since I became an adult. My life turned out pretty much how I had hoped it would, except for the periods of my life marked by  acute paranoid psychosis . \n That wasn't part of my plan. \n My mental health has been a topic I've been hesitant to bring up for a long time now, mostly out of fear of the stigma associated with mental health disorders. \n My family is no stranger to mental illnesses. Their effects have had deep repurcussions on my life growing up. But that's something I won't really go into. For this article, I'll be focusing on  my  mental health and the impact it has had on my life as an adult. \n To preface, I think the first recognizance of my mentla health came as a child when I was diagnosed with mild ADHD. I never really noticed the effects Adderall had on behavior or thoughts so I never took this diagnosis very seriously and was ultimately taken off the medication. I think the diagnosis was mostly related to the fact that I admitted to often having difficulty sleeping, a problem which would persist into my adult life with little impact on my responsibilities. \n By the time I graduated high school, I was independant, self-sufficient and most importantly, happy. My mental health was not on my radar at all. I knew I was relatively smart and capable and I prided myself on my ability to think critically and plan for the future. My confidence came from my recent  ACT  and  SAT  scores as well as the fact that I had achieved my goal of earning the rank of  Eagle Scout  before my 18th birthday. \n Life was good. \n Episode 1 \n \n   \n \n My first psychotic episode came unexpectedly. I was a sophomore at my university and it seemed like my life couldn't get any better. I was living off campus at an apartment that I was paying for through my internship I had at  DiSTI . \n \n   \n       \n           \n               \n                   \n                   \n                       \n                       \n                   \n               \n               \n               \n                   \n                       \n                           \n                               \n                                   \n                               \n                           \n                       \n                   \n               \n               \n                    View this post on Instagram \n               \n               \n               \n                   \n                       \n                       \n                       \n                   \n                   \n                       \n                       \n                   \n                   \n                       \n                       \n                       \n                   \n               \n               \n                   \n                   \n               \n           \n           \n               A post shared by Christofer Padilla (@rockzombie2) \n           \n       \n   \n   \n \n It was during my time at this apartment that it seemed to me that my life couldn't get any better. I had a very cool roommate that I got along well with. He introduced me to weed, something that I had researched myself in high school and was determined to try now that I was an adult. While I had a good smoking, I would usually limit myself to doing so only on weekends. \n Eventually, I'd slowly stop smoking for the most part, since I felt I had \"expanded my mind\" already in doing so, and it wasn't something I wanted to become a habit. By now, I had unprecidented levels of self-confidence. I would peacock with brightly colored clothing and hit on girls often. \n There was one girl in particular who I fancied and I began to grow more bold with her. I was cocky. Funny. I felt invincible. On top of the world. \n Manic. \n I felt like a different person entirely. Like something had awakened in me. A concsiousness that was mine but had remained dormant for so long that I didn't recognize it as my own. As if a new spirit had inhabited my body. \n \"I am Jesus Christ.\" I said while high with my brother one day. It was like an epiphany I had. My brother didn't like that. He was concerned but I convinced him I didn't really think that. And I didn't, excpet maybe figuratively. My parents being religious named my sister and I Christina and Christofer after Christ, as thanks for answering their prayers for twins. Growing up with a very religious upbringing, I thought perhaps  I  was the reincarnation of Christ. After all, we had been preached to for so long that we were in the \"latter days\" and that the second-coming was nigh upon us. \n This marked the beginning of my spiral into madness. Things in my life were going  too  well it seemed. Like a wheel spinning too fast before flying off it's axis, I lost control of myself. \n One day, I decided to chill on the grass in front of the Reflection pond. It was a gorgeous day. As I lay there throughout the day, others around me had the same idea and would stop to sit on the grass and enjoy the sunshine. \n It was here that I had my first vision. I peered into the sun and I saw the future. \n Aliens. \n We were woefully unprepared. There was an invasion approaching and I was the only one who knew about it. We had little time left and a lot of work to do. I needed to hustle. This, was Day 1. \n I knew I needed to reach a higher authority to warn someone about this. It was possible I was the new prophet. Throughout my life, I had always been blessed with the gift of vision. \n I tried to called my  bishop  and requested to speak to his superior. I had hoped to do so all the way up the chain of command until I could speak to the  prophet  himself. \n Of course, none of them believed me and I didn't make it very far. I was chided for not respecting the chain of command. Regardless, I met with my bishop still and confessed all my sins. \n I was now guilt free, able to act with a clear conscious. \n A few days later, I decided to walk to campus from my apartment. As I walked, I started to discard the contents of my wallet; wedging my ID cards between the edge of the sidewalk and the grass, hiding a card on top of a utility box jutting out from the side of a building. I think it symbolized to me the fact that I didn't need any kind of government ID to know who I was. \n Somehow, this was how I started to see the world, as symbols with deeper meanings. Every action I took, a parable; Every word spoken layered with double meanings. I was delusional and didn't realize it. \n I didn't go to class that day. Instead, I continued to walk around campus, chasing \"clues\" and following an unseen path I had discovered towards some unknown secret the symbols were revealing to me. Arbitrary numbers for times and locations were now codes hidden in plain sight, speaking to me. \n I was being watched , they said.  Followed. \n And why shouldn't I be? I was exceptional. An  Eagle Scout  without a mission. I was under the delusion that the government was recruiting me to be a top secret agent through a program that was hidden in plain sight, available to anyone with the aptitude to see the pattern. I believed that if I followed this path long enough, I would be \"flagged by the system\" and contacted for recruitment. In fact, I thought I was  already  being contacted. \n Subtitles on live TV were instructions programed for me at the precise moment that I glanced at them. Electronic cross walk signs were somehow a test of my patience. Even simple advertisements were products placed along my path to tempt or guide me. \n I had to shake my tail. I didn't want to be followed. \n I ditched my backpack. I dipped into a Barnes and Noble on campus. Grabbing a blue tanktop off the rack, I swapped it with my shirt and walked out of the store with my new disguise. \n Surrounding me everywhere were people with eadbuds. Every one of them, a potential agent receiving instructions from the unkown entity watching me. \n I started to become enraged. Was everyone in on this charade? How could they all give into the system? How could I be the only one breaking from the script? \n I entered the library; I knew where to find answers. \n Stepping into the elevator, I punched in the button for the top floor. The highest floor in one of the oldest buildings on campus. Surely this was where the headquarters would be hiding. \n The doors opened. To my dismay, before me lay the familiar layout of the top floor of the library. Unchanged. \n I shouldn't have been dissappointed, and yet I was. \n I left the building and took off my shirt, no longer caring about my disguise. I lay on the grass in front of the Reflection pond just outside the library. \n Two cops approached me. I don't remember what they said, but I went with them anyway. I was ready to be taken in. If this whole system was a lie, I had nothing left for me here. I was ready to embrace my destiny and be accepted into the program as a secret agent. \n To be continued. \n \n \n"},{title:"2022: No Excuses",frontmatter:{title:"2022: No Excuses",date:"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",description:"The year for no excuses.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Goals","New Year's Resolution"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/socrates-quote.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"2022: No Excuses"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"The year for no excuses."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/socrates-quote.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2022/1/1/2022-No-Excuses.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"2022: No Excuses"},{property:"og:description",content:"The year for no excuses."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/socrates-quote.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2022/1/1/2022-No-Excuses.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Goals"},{property:"article:tag",content:"New Year's Resolution"},{itemprop:"name",content:"2022: No Excuses"},{itemprop:"description",content:"The year for no excuses."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/socrates-quote.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2022/1/1/2022-No-Excuses.html",relativePath:"blog/2022/1/1/2022-No-Excuses.md",key:"v-2cec5d85",path:"/blog/2022/1/1/2022-No-Excuses.html",lastUpdated:"1/1/2022, 10:06:26 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1641092786e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n This year I'm going to keep things simple. I only have one resolution that I want to hold myself accountable for. \n I used the think that I would be in the prime years of my life by around 30 years of age. Now, as I approach that age, I find that I've let myself go and am running out of time to accomplish it. I've had excuses in the past, but now that I'm financially stable, I really have no excuse to not get into the best shape of my life. \n So that is my goal for this year. Everything else is secondary to that. To be specific and to have measurable goals, I want to beat my personal record for the following lifts: \n \n Bench Press: 205 lbs. \n Overhead Press: 165 lbs. \n Back Squat: 270 lbs. \n Deadlift: 285 lbs. \n \n I set a goal last year to lose a measurable amount of weight, which I failed, so I won't do that again. Instead, I want to get into  calisthenics  as a workout. I think as long as I can support my own body weight, I'll know I'm not overweight. I still have to look into how specifically I want to incorporate calisthenics into my workouts, but I think push-ups and pull-ups will suffice for now. \n Excercise is only half the battle, though. My other goals revolve around nutrition, and they are: \n \n Track calories consumed daily \n Cut out alchohol from my diet \n Restrict meat consumption \n Hit macro goals daily \n \n Most of this will be done via MyFitnessPal. \n That's pretty much it. I want to have fitness as my singular goal now in order to devote as much energy as I can to it. \n Cheers. \n \n \n"},{title:"2022: Summarized",frontmatter:{title:"2022: Summarized",date:"2022-12-20T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A reflection on a shitty year.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/51NYSkI489c/0.jpg",type:"post",tags:["Reflections"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/51NYSkI489c/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"2022: Summarized"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A reflection on a shitty year."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/51NYSkI489c/0.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2022/12/20/2022-Summarized.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"2022: Summarized"},{property:"og:description",content:"A reflection on a shitty year."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/51NYSkI489c/0.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2022/12/20/2022-Summarized.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2022-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{itemprop:"name",content:"2022: Summarized"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A reflection on a shitty year."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://img.youtube.com/vi/51NYSkI489c/0.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2022/12/20/2022-Summarized.html",relativePath:"blog/2022/12/20/2022-Summarized.md",key:"v-24c14dc5",path:"/blog/2022/12/20/2022-Summarized.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Turning Over a New Leaf",slug:"turning-over-a-new-leaf"}],lastUpdated:"12/20/2022, 11:06:37 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1671595597e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n I'll be honest: 2022 was a shitty year for me. I don't want to dwell on it, so I will summarize it briefly; I had another manic episode in February, which cost me  my job , one of the best that I've had so far. \n I went unemployed for six months after that, living off of my severance pay and looking for work. During this time, I thought I had all this free time that I could just start streaming again and be productive, but the reality was I was just depressed from losing a good job— maybe even my dream job. I stopped working out and gained weight again. \n When I finally found a new job, it quickly turned out poorly for me; I was underperforming and chaffing under the management there. \n Turning Over a New Leaf \n 2022 has been rough but there have been some diamonds forged in it. \n I started  streaming  again consistently after realizing I could run my preferred dev environment (FreeBSD) in a VirtualBox on Windows. This had the benefit of fitting in a nice 16:9 window on my super ultra wide monitor (32:9), which made it easier to stream from. I also no longer needed to choose between being productive or casually gaming upon boot-up as I did when I was dual-booting. I could seemlessly transition between the two operating systems with this new setup. \n Because I started streaming again, I decided to use  my TikTok  account to promote my streams.

Life  got in the way. \n I decided to pivot away from a  blockchain  based game in favor of a more traditional style of game. One where I have complete creative control and am not confined by the limitations of a blockchain. \n In the many times that I've previously attempted to begin creating the Space Pirates game, I've usually made the distinction of separating the engine out from the game. I last did this in  C++ using OpenGL . I even got pretty far with the engine. All this was done while following the  tutorial . \n Learned how to map material data such as the diffuse and specular lighting into separate texture files. As you can see here, the metal part of the container reflects more light than the wood. Neat! :) #gamedev   #gamedevelopment   pic.twitter.com/JF02HHuB9e — Christofer (@rockzombie2)  October 1, 2018   \n I've therefore decided to stay true to my original vision and create a custom game engine using Vulkan instead of OpenGL, since it's the newer API. I've basically been following the same steps as I did last time, where I'm creating the game engine initially by following a  Vulkan tutorial . \n \n I've already begun separating out the game engine from the base game. I'm hosting the code under my  CITY PLANNERS  github repository, as that is the studio I want to publish the game under. The base game is  Space Pirates  and it uses the  Bones Engine . \n \n     \n       \n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n     \n @Skyroor \n \n I decided to change the name from Warp Engine to Bones Engine because I think of bones as the framework that provides locomotion to our systems. Thus, I want a bones framework animating the life behind the pixels that are rendered to the screen. It's a working title and I reserve the right to rename it again at a later date, but I like it so far. \n You can follow my game development progress live on  Twitch ! \n \n \n"},{title:"The Bones Engine: Rust",frontmatter:{title:"The Bones Engine: Rust",date:"2023-01-03T00:00:00.000Z",description:"After exploring rust for a bit, I've decided to go all in.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"images/zero-to-production.png",type:"post",tags:["Space Pirates","Programming"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/zero-to-production.png"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"The Bones Engine: Rust"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"After exploring rust for a bit, I've decided to go all in."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/zero-to-production.png"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2023/1/3/The-Bones-Engine-Rust.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"The Bones Engine: Rust"},{property:"og:description",content:"After exploring rust for a bit, I've decided to go all in."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/zero-to-production.png"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2023/1/3/The-Bones-Engine-Rust.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2023-01-03T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Programming"},{itemprop:"name",content:"The Bones Engine: Rust"},{itemprop:"description",content:"After exploring rust for a bit, I've decided to go all in."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/zero-to-production.png"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2023/1/3/The-Bones-Engine-Rust.html",relativePath:"blog/2023/1/3/The-Bones-Engine-Rust.md",key:"v-c4edb436",path:"/blog/2023/1/3/The-Bones-Engine-Rust.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Cross-Platform Compatible",slug:"cross-platform-compatible"},{level:2,title:"Vulkan Tutorial",slug:"vulkan-tutorial"},{level:2,title:"Community",slug:"community"}],lastUpdated:"1/4/2023, 12:21:45 AM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1672809705e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n   \n   The Bones engine running on Rust. \n \n I've been using Rust recently. I had a co-worker who always mentioned wanting to learn Rust and I finally had the opportunity to do so with my most recent project of building my  Twitch bot  in Rust. \n Initially, I ran into issues with the borrow checker, simply trying to wrap my head around this  new type of memory management . I was also a bit conflicted in using it when I recently rediscovered a  streamer  I like who had some  strong opinions  on using Rust instead of Go. \n Despite this, I actually really like the Rust programming language. I appreciate the effort it puts into eliminating certain classes of mistakes you can make with it. I also really like it's crate ecosystem. \n Cross-Platform Compatible \n I started mulling over the idea of re-writing what little there currently is of my own  game engine  in Rust. \n Once I started looking into it a bit more, I realized it would solve some of the issue I'd been having with cross-platform compatibility. For starters, I wouldn't have to deal with CMake anymore, which has been somewhat of a drag on my whole learning curve. I was also having issues linking libraries in C++ on Windows because Windows has to be a special little snowflake and can't adhere to  Unix  standards (it's a Windows NT based operating system). \n These don't seem to be issues with Rust; Rust is cross-platform compatible, so there is no need for a special make system. I believe I can also convert the Bones Engine from it's current form as a library and package it as a crate. \n Vulkan Tutorial \n Finally, I found a  tutorial for Vulkan in Rust  which is pretty much a copy of the  Vulkan tutorial  I was following in C++. \n This means I can pretty much mirror the work that I've done so far in C++ in Rust by following the tutorial. \n I think the best way for me to learn a language is through practical application; Writing my game engine in Rust will allow me to learn Vulkan and Rust at the same time out of necessity. There are even some existing game engines in Rust that I can look at to learn from how a game engine might look. \n Community \n Because Rust is relatively new (it's been around for 10 years now) it has a smaller dev community supporting it. I've personally come across crates with outdated example code or code that just is straight up bugged. Working through these proved to be a valuable learning experience, however, and made me appreciate how most of the errors I encountered were compiler errors. \n Probably the most important reason for why I'm choosing to use Rust for my game engine is because it's fun! I haven't felt excited about learning a slick new language in a long time. It also has a  cute little mascot ! \n All of these reason are why I'll be writing the Bones Engine in Rust going forward. \n \n \n"},{title:"Updated Plan for Space Pirates",frontmatter:{title:"Updated Plan for Space Pirates",date:"2022-02-28T00:00:00.000Z",description:"A few points worth mentioning on the development of Space Pirates.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"https://christofer.rocks/images/lightningnetwork.jpeg",type:"post",tags:["Space Pirates","Blockchain"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/lightningnetwork.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Updated Plan for Space Pirates"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"A few points worth mentioning on the development of Space Pirates."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/lightningnetwork.jpeg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2022/2/28/UpdatedPlanForSpacePirates.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Updated Plan for Space Pirates"},{property:"og:description",content:"A few points worth mentioning on the development of Space Pirates."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/lightningnetwork.jpeg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2022/2/28/UpdatedPlanForSpacePirates.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2022-02-28T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Blockchain"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Updated Plan for Space Pirates"},{itemprop:"description",content:"A few points worth mentioning on the development of Space Pirates."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/lightningnetwork.jpeg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2022/2/28/UpdatedPlanForSpacePirates.html",relativePath:"blog/2022/2/28/UpdatedPlanForSpacePirates.md",key:"v-08695276",path:"/blog/2022/2/28/UpdatedPlanForSpacePirates.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"The Lightning Network",slug:"the-lightning-network"},{level:2,title:"Colored Bits",slug:"colored-bits"}],lastUpdated:"12/30/2022, 1:44:34 AM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1672382674e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n   \n   You can find other cool visualisations of The Lightning Network  here . \n \n Despite all my research into  designing a blockchain from the ground up , I have realized that I still wont be able to overcome one of the fundamental problems with starting a new blockchain, and that is incentivizing the miners (or stakers) to produce blocks on your chain. I came to this conclusion partly because of my belief that Bitcoin is the only useful application for a blockchain. \n \n With this realization, I had to admit to myself that if I tried starting a blockchain from the ground up, it was most likely doomed to fail because of this incentivization problem. Why spend hard-earned time and resource mining on a blockchain that is inherently inferior to Bitcoin? That is my belief, at least and it turned out to be justified because Bitcoin provides all the same tools I would need from another blockchain already; that is beauty of Bitcoin development: it's ongoing. \n The Lightning Network \n One of the common complaints about Bitcoin as compared to other cryptos is that it doesn't scale well, meaning it does not have a very high transactions per second. If you were looking just at the base layer, you'd be right. It's transactions are slower when compared against some other blockchains. However, The Lightning Network fixes this by building on the \"Layer 2\" network of Bitcoin. You can think of it like email: email is a protocl that rests on top of the main technology of the internet. Just so, The Lightning Network rests on top of Bitcoin as it's own protocol and provides near instantatneous speeds for transactions. \n Colored Bits \n Lastly, I stumlbed upon an article talking about the potential for a technique called  Colored Bits , which essentially lets you use the metadata of a bit to \"color\" it for a specific purpose. \n Between these two technologies on the Bitcoin blockchain, I think it's enough to satisfy most of my requirements for the game. So, moving forward, I'm going to be developing  Space Pirates  on the Bitcoin blockchain. \n \n \n"},{title:"2023: Consistency",frontmatter:{title:"2023: Consistency",date:"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",description:"My goals this year focus around being consistent.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["New Year's Resolution"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/calendar.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"2023: Consistency"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"My goals this year focus around being consistent."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/calendar.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2023/1/1/2023-Consistency.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"2023: Consistency"},{property:"og:description",content:"My goals this year focus around being consistent."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/calendar.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2023/1/1/2023-Consistency.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"New Year's Resolution"},{itemprop:"name",content:"2023: Consistency"},{itemprop:"description",content:"My goals this year focus around being consistent."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/calendar.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2023/1/1/2023-Consistency.html",relativePath:"blog/2023/1/1/2023-Consistency.md",key:"v-14955fff",path:"/blog/2023/1/1/2023-Consistency.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Goals",slug:"goals"},{level:3,title:"Physical Fitness Goals",slug:"physical-fitness-goals"},{level:3,title:"Mental Health Goals",slug:"mental-health-goals"},{level:3,title:"Productivity Goals",slug:"productivity-goals"}],lastUpdated:"1/2/2023, 9:51:57 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1672714317e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n Many of my goals remain the same as  last year . However, I'm shifting the focus of them to center around consistency. I still want to hit my physical goals this year, but my focus will be on hitting the gym 4 times a week rather than the more long term goal of breaking my PRs. \n     @sean_turner_integrated  Should have broke more ice. The hole wasnt big enough to complerely submerge in.    #chooseyourhard   ♬ original sound - Seanstiktok.edu       \n I was inspired by a TikTok I came across which highlighted the importance of choosing your suffering; Life is hard no matter what you choose to do, so it's best if you choose how you suffer. I'm tired of being fat, of not being happy with who I see in the mirror and I miss skateboarding and doing yoga and I want to be fit enough when I retire to still be able to surf. In order to change these things,  I  need to change. \n Goals \n I've set up my goals this year to be in an easy-to-manage format of weekly goals. Here are my goals for the following categories: \n Physical Fitness Goals \n Workout at the gym 4 days a week \n \n \n \n I've been using an app for a workout program I discovered on Reddit called  nsuns . The subreddit seems to be dead actually and the app I have on my phone doesn't seem to exist on the Play store anymore, so I might have to look for a new app, but the one I've been using has been functional enough for me. I've stuck with the program consistently, so that's all that matters. \n Skateboard twice a week (during summer/warm weather) \n \n \n \n I miss skateboarding. I used to be the president of the UCF Skateboarding Club. I'm unhappy if I can't skate. I have no more excuses anymore, there is plenty of flat ground right outside my apartment and a skatepark I can walk to. I'm gonna start skating as soon as the weather permits, which honestly is now, I just need to get over the slight chill. \n Track every meal's calories in MyFitnessPal \n \n \n \n There was a trend I noticed when I first lost a bunch of weight in college. That was, I was exercising regularly, eating cleanly and tracking the calories that I ate. This seems like a simple one to stay consistent with. \n Cut out sugar (one cheat item per week) \n \n \n \n Part of eating cleanly includes removing sugar from my diet. I got into the bad habit of drinking energy drinks (for some reason) this past year. Sugary drinks seem to be the main form of sugar I intake, so this should be easy to cut. Removing sugar from my diet will leave only fat for my body to burn as fuel. \n OMAD Diet \n \n \n \n I've found success in the past with losing weight in intermittent fasting. The  One-Meal-A-Day diet  basically is intermittent fasting daily. This might be hard for me, but losing weight is hard either way, so I'm just going to have to deal with it. \n Go sailing again in the summer \n \n \n \n Last year I took a sailing class which was part of my lifelong dream of becoming a pirate and sailing the seas. It was amazing and I want to keep my sailing skills up by regularly visiting the harbor on my weekends to catch sail with a crew. \n Mental Health Goals \n Walk outside everyday \n \n \n \n Should be pretty easy to hit. I have to walk to the bus to go to work some days anyway. The rest of the days there is a park nearby I can walk to. \n Do Yoga 4 times a week \n \n \n \n When I lost a lot of weight, I was doing yoga regularly. I want yoga to become a regular part of my routine again, so I decided I'm going to keep it in line with my fitness goal of going to the gym; I'll do yoga before I go to the gym each time. \n Write in my journal at least once a week \n \n \n \n It's easy to neglect writing in my journal, especially if I'm writing blog posts consistently, but I want to ensure I still take the time to write with pen on paper, as it's not only therapeutic for me, but meditative. \n Productivity Goals \n Stream 4 days a week \n \n \n \n I've been streaming pretty regularly lately, so instead of coming up with goals surround my  game  and  game engine , I figure if I stay consistent with streaming (when I'm always productive), I will make great progress with my game. \n Study Japanese \n \n \n \n My friends and I are planning a trip to Japan in March this year, so I'd like to brush up on my Japanese vocabulary which I had learned from my flash cards when I took Japanese in college. I hope to have a beginner's level of proficiency by March. \n \n My goals are simple this year, so I hope that I'll be able to stick to them and hold myself accountable on a weekly basis. \n \n \n"},{title:"2023: Reflections",frontmatter:{title:"2023: Reflections",date:"2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Reflections on 2023 and New Year Resolutions.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","New Year's Resolution"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Welcome-To-Japan.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"2023: Reflections"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Reflections on 2023 and New Year Resolutions."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Welcome-To-Japan.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2024/1/3/2023-Reflections.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"2023: Reflections"},{property:"og:description",content:"Reflections on 2023 and New Year Resolutions."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Welcome-To-Japan.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2024/1/3/2023-Reflections.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"New Year's Resolution"},{itemprop:"name",content:"2023: Reflections"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Reflections on 2023 and New Year Resolutions."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/Welcome-To-Japan.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2024/1/3/2023-Reflections.html",relativePath:"blog/2024/1/3/2023-Reflections.md",key:"v-750c92b6",path:"/blog/2024/1/3/2023-Reflections.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Japan",slug:"japan"},{level:3,title:"Tokyo",slug:"tokyo"},{level:3,title:"Beppu",slug:"beppu"},{level:3,title:"Kurokawa",slug:"kurokawa"},{level:3,title:"Hiroshima",slug:"hiroshima"},{level:3,title:"Osaka",slug:"osaka"},{level:3,title:"Kyoto",slug:"kyoto"},{level:3,title:"Tokyo",slug:"tokyo-2"},{level:2,title:"Utah (Melissa's Graduation)",slug:"utah-melissa-s-graduation"},{level:2,title:"Florida",slug:"florida"},{level:2,title:"Utah (Thanksgiving)",slug:"utah-thanksgiving"},{level:3,title:"Walt Disney World: Galaxy's Edge",slug:"walt-disney-world-galaxy-s-edge"},{level:2,title:"Reflections for the New Year",slug:"reflections-for-the-new-year"}],lastUpdated:"1/3/2024, 11:05:19 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1704341119e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n   \n   Kinkaku-ji \n \n 2023 was a good year. I think I can say that because the highs outweighted the lows of most of the rest of the year. It wasn't all good, but the good times were great, indeed. \n I turned 30 this year! The big three oh. I don't feel that old, but I'm sure the zoomers would disagree. \n A lot happened this year so I'm going to reflect over it in this post. \n Japan \n The year started out great. I was sticking with my plan to remain  consistent , for the most part. I was working out, cooking, streaming and generally just taking care of myself. \n Things were stressfull at work, however. My boss pretty much hated me and I was being told I was not performing to the level they expected from me. It was pretty toxic, honestly. All of that came to a head when, right before my 3 week vacation I had been planning with my friends to Japan, I was let go. \n This cast a dire shadow over my vacation but I decided to continue to go despite this because I had worked so hard planning this vacation. \n Realizing I would have to move back home to Florida, I checked the parking garage where I had my car parked to see if it had a hitch. I found the rear passenger window had been smashed in and the ignition switch was all fucked up. This was just another stone to add to my burden, but I would deal with it when I got back from Japan. \n \n I ended up staying up all night to catch my flight because I don't trust myself to wake up early to my alarm clock (notoriously late sleeper). I watched the Jujutsu Kaisen movie because apparently there was a Jujutsu Kaisen ride at Universal Studios Japan. \n I flew to Canada first before flying to Tokyo, where I would meet everyone else on the trip. It would be me, Dougie, his girlfriend-- Sierra, Matt, Kyle, Mikey, and Sierra's friend Jasmine. Jasmine was in the military stationed in Japan so she met us at the domestic airport. \n Unfortunately, it's been a while since the trip and I never wrote an extensive article on my adventures like I planned to, so instead I'll summarize it as much as I can, talking about a few specific photos that I took from the trip that I liked. \n \n This was the itinerary. It was a part of a much larger Google Sheet that I encouraged the group to use to plan. We followed it pretty much to the letter, except later in our 3 week journey as fatigue got the best of us. \n Tokyo \n After we all met at the airport, we made our way to a pod hotel. There was a mishap with the bus we took so we ended up having to walk back to the bus station so by the time we made it to the pod hotel, we were all pooped. \n \n The next morning we walked over to a little coffee shop called  Glitch Coffee & Roasters . It was literally the best coffee I've ever had! \n Beppu \n We took a domestic flight down to Beppu, which was a city known for it's \"Hells\" hot springs. It was a fun tourist attraction and I had an onsen egg. Delicious! \n Kurokawa \n We then took a bus further inland to Kurokawa, were we stayed at a Ryoken, a traditional Japanese inn. We had some of the best multi-course dinners here and it was great checking out all of the different onsens! As beautiful as all the onsens were, there's not a lot of photos of them because we were all nakey-nakey! 🤭 \n Hiroshima \n Hiroshima was awesome. It was a surprisingly modern feeling city. The AirBnB we stayed at was very chic. We took a ferry to Miyajima Island which was very cool. There were a lot of deer walking around and lots of delicious street food! \n Osaka \n We took the  Shinkansen  to Osaka. We all were responsible for planning one city during the trip and Osaka was my responsibility. We walked to Dotonbori and checked out all the cool street vendors. We even got conveyor belt sushi! (Would not recommend; two of us got sick from it.) \n Nara \n We were staying in Osaka for a few days so we had a few day trips planned out. The first day we had the Nara Bike tour, which ended up being my favorite thing we did on the trip! It was so cool to be guided by a local to these beautiful destinations full of cherry blossoms in full bloom. \n Universal Studios Japan \n The next day we went to Universal Studios Japan! I was so looking forward to it. It was pretty fun. The Jujutsu Kaisen ride was pretty mid but Super Mario World was cool. \n \n     \n   Why yes, I did upload that photo to Google Maps. \n Himeji \n The last day trip we had planned was visiting Himeji Castle! Not gonna lie, I had hella blisters at this time and having to take our shoes off to walk the hard, wooden floors of the castle was brutal. I think I enjoyed it from the outside more than I enjoyed it from the inside. \n Kyoto \n At this point in the trip, I think we were all feeling a little burnt out. We had a bunch of temple visits planned but the only one I was interested in was the Fushimi Inari Shrine, or the Thousand Gates Shrine. That was honestly such a climb but it was totally worth it. We got a bunch of great pics. \n \n Besides that, we pretty much chilled and did whatever. Me and Matt went shopping and found a Gundam store which was pretty cool. \n Tokyo \n Finally: Tokyo. The grand destination on our trip. Tokyo was huge but I loved the cities inside of it that we visited, namely Shinjuku and Shibuya. I really fell in love with the night life. I won't go into all the details but suffice it to say: Tokyo was lit. \n I had a few drinks at the Golden Gai, a really tightly packed area full of bars with both locals and foreigners alike. One of the owners of a bar beckoned me in as I walked past and I ended up having the most wonderful time with a bunch of strangers. There was nothing but good vibes all around! \n \n I also had  the  best ramen I've ever had at a small ramen shop I found. I don't even remember the name of it it, but I got in a conversation about Dragon Ball Z with the owner while he made me ramen. I still miss that ramen. \n \n It's really hard to summarize the entire 3 week stay but I tried to do it justice with a little TikTok I made. \n     @rockzombie2   Spent my 30th birthday in Japan with friends and it was awesome 🇯🇵   ♬ original sound - Christofer       \n Utah (Melissa's Graduation) \n The Japan trip was awesome, and it's one of those things you'll never forget. I hope to make it back there someday. \n I was gonna write up all the shit I had to deal with my car but I decided I don't need to rehash all that bullshit. Suffice it to say, my car ended up being stuck in the shop, meaning I would have to go through PODS once more to move cross-country. \n In the meatime, I had already paid for the next month of rent of my very expensive apartment, so I decided I could afford to go visit my sister in Utah for her graduation. We were all very proud of her and this would be a family reunion of sorts. \n I'm thankful I got to visit my wonderful little sister for her graduation. \n Florida \n I finally moved out in the beginning of May. I'm grateful to my good friend Doug for having a spare bedroom I could move into while I get on my feet. Also grateful that there was an opening at his company for a Java Engineer which I applied to and ultimately got hired for a month later. So I didn't end up out of work for as long as I was in 2022. \n I managed to build back my savings working out the rest of the year. I didn't have my car (still don't) but I'm working on getting it back as soon as it's fixed. This gave me a lot of time to really work on myself since I didn't have anywhere to go. \n Utah (Thanksgiving) \n I made plans to visit my sister once again along with my twin sister, her girlfriend and my mom for Thanksgiving. We decided to rent out an AirBnB to do Thanksgiving in and it was such a good idea! We had a blast just cooking dishes and watching festive movies. They even had a hot tub! \n Walt Disney World: Galaxy's Edge \n For Christmas, Matt and Kyle were coming down to Orlando to visit Family. We all wanted to get dinner sometime and I suggested that we go to an amusement park for fun! I had never been to the Star Wars part of Disney (Galaxy's Edge). \n We decided to do it so I invited my brother Carlos and another friend of mine from high school, who I'd reconnected with when I moved back to Orlando, Justin. \n It was awesome! I signed up for the Savi's Workshop experience, where you get to build a lightsaber because I thought it'd be a fun way to commemorate this event and even this year as I turned 30. \n \n Of course, I immediately made a TikTok of my new toy when I got home. \n     @rockzombie2  I see thru the lies of the Jedi!  #lightsaber   ♬ original sound - Léa Martinez       \n Reflections for the New Year \n I noticed towards the later half of the year, my mental health started to really improve. I was taking better care of myself, I scheduled an appointment with a therapist and I'd been getting back into my hobbies like table top RPGs, working out and cooking. \n I think, now that I'm 30, it's time I start establishing myself a little better. Even though I'm still not entirely sure on where I want to settle down, I think I should work towards owning a house. Living here with Dougie has made me appreciate owning a home. My credit score went up this year, which is a huge relief as I can realistically start working towards a mortgage. I think given two years time, I will have enough saved up for a mortgage down payment. \n So while I think my financial goals will span two years, I've come up with a few goals for 2024. \n \n Workout consistently \n Practice my Japanese \n \n I think I want to be hunble with a few manageable goals. I think I can continue in keeping with my consistency theme from last year and forgive myself for not keeping with it considering I had a major life event happen that disrupted my consistency. \n Overally, 2024 has been off to a great start. 2023 was great and I can't wait for what's in store for the new year! \n \n \n"},{title:"2025 New Year's Resolutions",frontmatter:{title:"2025 New Year's Resolutions",date:"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",description:"My New Year's Resolution for 2025.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["New Year's Resolution"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/MegaCon-Cosplay.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"2025 New Year's Resolutions"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"My New Year's Resolution for 2025."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/MegaCon-Cosplay.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2025/1/1/2025-New-Years-Resolutions.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"2025 New Year's Resolutions"},{property:"og:description",content:"My New Year's Resolution for 2025."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/MegaCon-Cosplay.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2025/1/1/2025-New-Years-Resolutions.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"New Year's Resolution"},{itemprop:"name",content:"2025 New Year's Resolutions"},{itemprop:"description",content:"My New Year's Resolution for 2025."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/MegaCon-Cosplay.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2025/1/1/2025-New-Years-Resolutions.html",relativePath:"blog/2025/1/1/2025-New-Years-Resolutions.md",key:"v-21fcfde9",path:"/blog/2025/1/1/2025-New-Years-Resolutions.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"2025 New Year's Resolution",slug:"_2025-new-year-s-resolution"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"use-duolingo"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"stick-with-ynab"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"stream-at-least-2-days-a-week"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"write-an-article-a-month"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"write-6-rough-draft-chapters-of-my-book"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"get-my-hand-tattoo"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"get-nipples-pierced"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"go-to-the-gym-regularly"},{level:3,title:"",slug:"enroll-for-a-master-s-degree"}],lastUpdated:"12/31/2024, 6:39:18 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1735688358e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n 2024 was a good year. I'll try my best to summarize it for you. \n In January, I saw Travis Scott live, It was epic; he brought out Kanye West as a special guest. The reveal was super hype. \n In February, my friends and I went to MegaCon, a local nerdy convention. I dressed up as a Jedi with my lightsaber. \n \n The Star Wars Unlimited trading card game came out, and I played that for a while. It was really fun and I even got lucky and pulled a super rare showcase variant of the most popular leader, Boba Fett. I got it graded: 9.5. It went down in price recently after Fantasy Flight Games  suspended  the card. \n \n I redid my entire linux setup, adding a few more drives and choosing ZFS as my file system, using RAIDZ2 redundancy. This basically was meant to be my end game OS, allowing me to have a safe place to store digital files for years to come. \n Crazy enough, I had been living in Florida this whole time without a car. It was unfortunately stuck in Seattle while the engine was being replaced by my insurance. I basically went a full year without my car. Finally, in May, it was delivered to me and I got to have a car again! \n I celebrated my one year anniversary working at Oddball. It's been a great company to work at and I've been very happy working here. \n I started looking for a place of my own to move into during the summer and found a cozy little duplex right off of Mills avenue near downtown Orlando. I really liked the location and pulled the trigger on it, moving into it July 13th. \n \n In September I saw a band I really liked called Eli & Fur. It was around this time that I started playing Poker again at some home games. I also played a lot of Commander again. \n \n My sister came and visited me in October. We had a blast hanging out and we also went to Halloween Horror Nights, which was pretty fun. \n I won a costume contest with my Halloween costume! \n \n Christmas was great this year; my sister and her girlfriend flew in to Orlando and stayed at an AirBnB. We did a Christmas crawl between all of our houses, which resulted in a very fun Christmas time! I also got to spoil my niece and nephew which was fun. \n Overall, I would say I'm very happy this with where I'm at in life at this point in time. \n 2025 New Year's Resolution \n I have a lot of goals for 2025. \n  Use Duolingo \n \n My  resolution  last year was to practice my Japanese more regularly. That failed pretty miserably. \n I've proven I can't stick to a learning regiment on my own so I'm hoping Duolingo will be the structure I need to stick with learning another language. \n  Stick with YNAB \n \n This one's pretty simple. Budget every Sunday and stick to it. \n  Stream at least 2 days a week \n \n Stream on Twitch on Mondays and Saturdays regularly. \n  Write an article a month \n \n The whole point of having a blog is to write more. \n  Write 6 rough draft chapters of my book \n \n My goal is to write a book one day. This is a concrete step towards that goal. \n  Get my hand tattoo \n \n I've been wanting to get a hand tattoo from  this guy  for a while now. \n He's in Los Angeles, California, so my plan is to book a trip there. It'd be a good excuse to visit. \n \n                 View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by Eddie Lee • Los Angeles Tattoo Artist (@eddiexbird) \n  Get nipples pierced \n \n I like my nips. I want to get them pierced. \n  Go to the gym regularly \n \n Two times a week on Tuesday and Thursday. \n Walk at least 30 minutes. \n  Enroll for a Master's Degree \n \n I want to enroll in  Georgia Tech's online master's degree program  since my work will pay for it. \n The deadline to apply for the Fall is March 1st! \n \n Overall, I'm feeling much more confident this year about my goals. \n Happy New Year! \n \n \n"},{title:"Moving to Japan",frontmatter:{title:"Moving to Japan",date:"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z",description:"I decided I want to move to Japan some day.",author:"Christofer Padilla",image:"/images/niceshrine.jpg",type:"post",tags:["Reflections","Goals"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/niceshrine.jpg"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Moving to Japan"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"I decided I want to move to Japan some day."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/niceshrine.jpg"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2025/1/9/Moving-to-Japan.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Moving to Japan"},{property:"og:description",content:"I decided I want to move to Japan some day."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/niceshrine.jpg"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2025/1/9/Moving-to-Japan.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2025-01-09T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Goals"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Moving to Japan"},{itemprop:"description",content:"I decided I want to move to Japan some day."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/niceshrine.jpg"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2025/1/9/Moving-to-Japan.html",relativePath:"blog/2025/1/9/Moving-to-Japan.md",key:"v-b63dacb6",path:"/blog/2025/1/9/Moving-to-Japan.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"Learning Japanese",slug:"learning-japanese"},{level:2,title:"Timeline",slug:"timeline"},{level:2,title:"Reflection",slug:"reflection"}],lastUpdated:"1/9/2025, 11:08:03 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1736482083e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n   \n   A nice shrine in Kyoto from my 2023 trip. \n \n When I was around 17, I was in Boy Scouts and nearing the deadline to reach the rank of Eagle Scout. It was something that I really wanted to achieve. Each rank has certain time requirements associated with it so I worked backwards and calculated how much time it would take to meet these requirements before I turned 18. \n It turned out, I was very close to a month away from being too late to achieve my Eagle Scout rank. With the full perspective of my path towards my goal, I was motivated to take action and complete my objective. \n I had an epiphany recently: I'm a very goal oriented person. I thrive when I have an objective and a clear path towards success. It should be apparent by that fact that I've been making\n New Year's resolutions  for about a decade now. \n 2024 was me getting back on my feet, but I feel like I'm thriving now. \n Learning Japanese \n I've been sticking to my  New Year's resolution  to use Duolingo daily. However, I started thinking about my motivation behind learning the language; It's because eventually, \n I want to move to Japan. \n With this in mind, I began planning my path to achieving my dream. \n It turns out, there is a shortage of digital workers in Japan.  Japan is projected to fall short of 2.3 million digital workers in 2026.  This creates opportunities for foreign workers like myself to be able to gain entry into the country via a work visa. I already found some  job postings  that I could potentially apply to. \n Based on this video I watched, it sounded like I would have an advantage over the competition if I had two things: Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) level N2 or a master's degree. \n \n   \n \n As it so happens, I'm already on my way to getting a master's degree. That leaves passing the JLPT. It turns out, Duolingo is not so great at helping you pass the JLPT. While I'll continue to use it to supllement my learning, I decided I needed a proper course set on helping me pass the first level, JLPT N5. \n Luckily enough, there was a  course on Udemy  I found on sale that I picked up. I also found a handy  Flashcard maker  app that I bought to create flashcards on my phone for the vocab. \n With this guided structure for learning, I decided it's time to revisit my goal for this year. In addition to using Duolingo daily, I want to also practice my vocab and learn from my JLPT course each day in order to pass the JLPT N5 test by the end of the year. \n Timeline \n I would like to move to Japan while I'm still in my 30s. Working backwards, I'm almost 32 now, so that would give me 8 years at maximum to make this happen. \n If I were to take one class a semester, I estimate that I'd complete my master's degree in six years. While this puts me within range of my goal, I would like to see if I can finish my master's degree in half the time by taking two classes a semester. I should like to try this for my first semester to see if this is sustainable. \n The reality of the situation is that if I were to take a job in Japan, I'd most likely be making a fraction of what I am currently making in the US. Therefore, it might be more prudent to take my time in preparing to move so that I can maximize the money I save before moving. \n At this point in my career, I've worked in big tech and I've realized money isn't as important as a good work life balance but it's still an important balance that should be made. \n Thankfully, I have set another goal this year to budget weekly, which should help me save money towards moving to Japan in the future. \n Reflection \n In the end, I realize that I haven't been making the most of my time because I haven't had a real goal that I've been working towards. After I lost my job in Seattle, I basically just was living from day to day. \n I think I have the capacity to focus my time and energy into achieving my goals, so long as I have worthwhile goals. So this year, I want to be more focused, going about my day intentionally. I set up my whiteboard in my house, finally, so I can start writing my daily and weekly goals on it and see it every day. \n Now that I've written down my intentions, it will surely come to pass. \n \n \n"},{title:"Anti-Consumption",frontmatter:{title:"Anti-Consumption",date:"2025-02-25T00:00:00.000Z",description:"Vote with your wallet.",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Reflections"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/vote-with-your-dollar.webp"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"Anti-Consumption"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"Vote with your wallet."},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/vote-with-your-dollar.webp"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2025/2/25/Anti-Consumption.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"Anti-Consumption"},{property:"og:description",content:"Vote with your wallet."},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/vote-with-your-dollar.webp"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2025/2/25/Anti-Consumption.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2025-02-25T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Reflections"},{itemprop:"name",content:"Anti-Consumption"},{itemprop:"description",content:"Vote with your wallet."},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/vote-with-your-dollar.webp"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2025/2/25/Anti-Consumption.html",relativePath:"blog/2025/2/25/Anti-Consumption.md",key:"v-6d9b42b6",path:"/blog/2025/2/25/Anti-Consumption.html",headers:[{level:2,title:"February 28th",slug:"february-28th"},{level:2,title:"Considerations",slug:"considerations"},{level:3,title:"Instagram",slug:"instagram"},{level:3,title:"Google",slug:"google"},{level:3,title:"Amazon",slug:"amazon"},{level:3,title:"Groceries and Clothing",slug:"groceries-and-clothing"}],lastUpdated:"2/25/2025, 11:13:26 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1740543206e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n I'm a bit of a rebel. \n I'm a skater. I don't respect the authority of anyone who tries to tell me \"no\" * . In my opinion, the only real power authority has is the threat of force. And if your power is \"do this or I'll hurt you\", I don't respect you either. It's why I hate cops. \n But anyway,  the powers that b  have gotten a little too fat off of consumer spending so we are now ruled by, quite literally, evil mega-corporations. It used to be Google's motto:  Don't be evil. \n \n \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\" \n \n There's another saying I'm fond of, which really is instrumental in waging war against corporate greed, and that is: \n \n \"Vote with your wallet.\" \n \n It's why I buy Bitcoin. (But if anyone asks, I lost my keys in a boating accident.) I recognize the only real power we all have is the power to say \"no\" right back at them. \n Take a look at this video. \n \n   \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n \n If this isn't a wake-up call, I don't know what is. \n Guess what? I don't want to support this financial system. What do I do? I opt out (buy Bitcoin.  Seriously. ). It's not the first time I've opted out of something I don't support. Since college, I've been using various free and open source operating systems as opposed to Windows. In 2020,  I deleted Facebook and made this blog instead . \n In this sense, I've always been a rebel. Choosing to opt out and put my money where my mouth is. \n Today is no different. \n February 28th \n I keep tabs on various subreddits and one of them caught my attention recently.  r/Anticonsumption  posted the above image which reminded me about their effort to \"opt out\" of the economy in 2025. \n No Buy Movement  by u/Pitiful_Click  in Anticonsumption \n It might sound crazy, but I truly believe this is the only way things can change. At the very least, it is well within my realm of possible actions I can take against this corrupt system. \n There are a number of events planned for 2025, but one of the first one's happening this Friday, February 28th: A full, economic blackout. No spending and cancel your subscriptions. \n Considerations \n While I am in favor of boycotting a number of major corporations, there are some considerations I will have to take when canceling some of my major subscriptions. \n Instagram \n The irony of deleting Facebook is that I still use (however sparingly) Instagram, which is still supporting Meta. I don't even use it that much, except to keep track of my local  silent book club  and to message tattoo artists. \n As I've been socializing lately, I notice people still defer to Instagram as the default means of connecting with. Going forward, I could just ask for people's phone number instead. But I think minimizing my use of the app while I figure out how not to cut off my social circle that exists only on Instagram might be enough for me to keep it around for now. \n Google \n This one is going to be tough. Since I've used the internet, I've relied— nay, I've  trusted  Google to safe keep my data in the cloud. I use Google, I use Gmail, I use Google Nest devices. These are all things that will be difficult (but not impossible) to replace. I've already switched to  Duck Duck Go . I have a  raspberry pi  lying around and there are open source AI implementations like  Open Voice OS  so I could possibly create my own smart device. These will be among some of the things I will be considering on Friday when I cancel my subscriptions. \n Amazon \n This will be the biggest sacrifice in convenience. In reality, it will probably be easier than I think since most things that are sold on Amazon can be bought directly from the vendors website. Will I get next day delivery? Possibly not. But I think that's a small price to pay, actually. \n Groceries and Clothing \n Fortunately for me, I don't shop at Walmart or Target. I live close by to a  Publix , which is an employee owned business. I also live within walking distance to a local Asian supermarket and a second hand clothing store. This will be a good excuse to walk to and patron these locations. \n \n I hope, in reading my thoughts on the matter, you will choose to take actions similar or at the very least, opt out of spending money for one day. \n \n \n"},{title:"Featured Articles",frontmatter:{description:"",meta:[{name:"twitter:title",content:"Featured

AM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1743483804e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n It's been a long month.  Last month , I wrote about a movement to boycott the big tech companies and \"opt out\" of the economy on February 28th. \n I did that. The day before, I bought all my groceries ahead of time and then the day of, I cooked all my meals, cancelled my subscriptions, and then hung out and played Magic with my friends. The joy and beauty of this action was that I didn't have to disrupt my life to stick the middle finger to the oligarchs. I could simply be more conscious of the choices I made and how I spent my money. \n Anti-Consumption Lifestyle Changes \n I have to say, I was pretty excited by this whole notion. It  feels good  to spend money, knowing it's going to a good cause and not just having it slip through your fingers to the monopoly on convenience. \n Since February 28th, I haven't purchased anything from Amazon and honestly, it hasn't been as big of an inconvenience as I thought. First of all, since I cancelled my Amazon Prime subscription, I think I've been buying less things online. I still bought the usually things I  would  have purchased, I just bought them directly from retailers. For example, I bought my favorite hot sauce on sale from  heathotsauce.com ; I purchased more of my classic white t-shirts from  strongsize.com . \n Let's be real, the 2-day delivery guarantee— the convenience that you are paying for, is the only thing that is lost from ditching Amazon. After I wrote my last article, my sister in-law let me know that her and my brother have not been using Amazon for almost 2 years now. \n Part of the reason for doing this is to direct your money to supporting local businesses instead. I spent a lot of time thinking about this and how, what I like to call, being a \"responsible consumer\" has changed my life. I'm going to go over the three main areas that I considered being a responsible consumer in: social media, grocery stores, and technology that I use. \n Social Media \n Bluesky \n \n I liked Twitter. I guess you could say I enjoy micro-blogging and reading other peoples micro-blog posts. \n X is... not really Twitter anymore. There has been a growing sentiment of people who feel that the platform has been overrun by bots, but not only that, but by far right extremists as well. While I'm generally against forms of censorship, the following comic (I found floating around on Blusky when I first joined) explains pretty well the dynamic that occurs with platforms without enforcement of community guidelines. \n \n Either way, I switched over to Bluesky because of the vibes and to stop directly supporting Elon Musk. What I've found on Bluesky is that it feels very much like early Twitter (at least what I remember from my rose-tinted glasses). Is it left-leaning? Yes, absolutely. I think many people motivated to leave X for a new platform are going to be left-leaning, and honestly: I prefer it to a right-leaning platform. \n Politics, aside, the  real  reason why I switched to Bluesky is because the technology is so much better! Let me tell you about all the cool features of Bluesky. \n AT Protocol \n Bluesky is built on the  AT Protocol . The AT Protocol is a protocol and open standard for distributed social networking services. The protocol was created as an independent research group within Twitter to investigate the possibility of decentralizing the service. Note, this does not mean it's built on the blockchain! The really cool thing about this is the moderation is decentralized, allowing different levels of moderation by communities. \n The details on this are very interesting and it actually solves the problem outlined in the comic above! Basically, the protocol allows for different parties (platforms, third-party moderators, or users) to apply labels to content, accounts, or posts. Users and services can then choose which labels to follow, tailoring their content experience. \n As far as design is concerned, rather than having a monolithic database hosting the user data and application, the AT Protocol splits up these elements into smaller microservices which can be used as needed. It's designed as an open protocol, encouraging third-party innovation by allowing developers to build apps on the protocol. \n The two pieces of tech I really like are that your username is your domain name. You get one for free from  bsky.app  or you can register your own. I registered mine using  rockzombie2.gg . \n The second piece of tech I really like is that no longer are you beholden to  The Algorithm ! Instead, you can subscribe to different Feeds which tailor your timeline. \n If you're interested further, I suggest reading the  Wikipedia article  or do what I did and ask ChatGPT to summarize the benefits of the protocol. \n Follow me on Bluesky!  @rockzombie2.gg \n Flashes \n \n Although I left Facebook many years ago, I still kept Instagram, mostly because I found there was no good alternative for it. I realized this still tethered me to Mark Zuckerberg, but it was something I chose to live with as I still had many friends who use the platform. \n Flashes is a nice app which serves as an Instagram clone but built on the AT Protocol! Pretty neat, if I do say so myself. Unfortunately, Flashes is only available for iPhones currently. The creator has started a  GoFundMe campaign  in order to bring Flashes to Android, which I've contributed to. I think it'll come out eventually anyway, but this helps fund development and \"if all goes well\", a full Android version should come out in 2 months. \n Grocery Stores \n Publix \n \n I liked shopping at Publix. It was local, the BOGO deals were fire and the  Pub Sub  hype was real. \n Then I saw this response on Bluesky: \n They donate loads of money to right wing corporations that love holding down minorities, taking away the freedom of women to choose, and they love Hitler Trump.  Fuck Publix. — Jeff Schwartz ( @jeffschwartz.bsky.social )  March 4, 2025 at 10:50 PM \n I was surprised. So I looked into it. And sure enough,  Publix's  recent political leanings favor conservative causes. \n \n According to the Miami New Times, Publix's recent political leanings favor conservative causes, such as opposing the legalization of medical marijuana and the regulation of polystyrene, better known by the brand name Styrofoam. Publix also contributes to the PAC supporting Ron DeSantis, who some conservatives argue is a business-friendly governor. \n \n Not the worst. But then I found out about this bitch: \n \n Julie Jenkins Fancelli  (born 1949 or 1950) is an American heiress and conservative political donor. She is an heiress to the Publix supermarkets fortune and a member of America's thirty-ninth richest family. Fancelli's organizational efforts and donations played a decisive role in the January 6, 2021, \"Stop the Steal\" rally at The Ellipse that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol. \n \n Yikes. And I couldn't stomach seeing my money go towards someone who ultimately will fund shit like this. So I stopped shopping at Publix. I still use it as my pharmacy and I get certain paper and plastic products from it. But shopping there had no longer become a pleasure. \n Not to fear, because this opened my eyes to the plenty of other wholesome options that are near by me. \n The Fresh Market \n \n The Fresh Market! Being the next closest grocery store to my house. This one checks out. No obvious atrocities committed. And it even was named the \"Best Grocery Store in America\" from 2021 to 2023 by USA Today. Not bad! \n The only reason why I don't shop here regularly is because the specific location near me has lower than average reviews which I'm sure has something to do with the rather small parking lot that is often full. I do like that they sell  Tony's Chocolonelys  there. \n Trader Joe's \n \n I used to shop at Trader Joe's in college. It was very expensive, I'll say that. \n Recently, however, there is a Trader Joe's further down the road from The Fresh Market near my house. I've been there once. It's kind of hard to shop there when I drive past a grocery store to get there. \n Besides that, I read the  Wikipedia article  for Trader Joe's and learned some interesting things. Trader Joe's has been accused of union busting in numerous cases. Trader Joe's has also been accused of contributing to gentrification. I guess they mostly build locations mostly in well-off neighborhoods. \n But they also have sustainability initiatives like committing to all their eggs being cage-free by 2025 and improving packaging to be more environmentally friendly. \n Ultimately, I think shopping here is alright, if not inconvenient. \n Sprouts Farmers Market \n \n Finally, the farmers market I've been wanting to talk about! \n This place is great. It started out as a fresh-fruit stand in San Diego, California which grew into a handful of open-air farmers markets. Eventually, they came together with a bunch of stores and rebranded to Sprouts. The company has donated millions in charitable giving since then. \n What I love most about this grocery store is their commitment to \"zero waste\". \n \n Sprouts participates in a food waste diversion program that provides food to those in need, feed for animals, and nutrients for agricultural soil. All edible food that is no longer fit for sale is donated to hunger-relief agencies, and food that is not fit for them is donated as cattle feed. Everything else is donated as compost. \n \n Since shopping there, I discovered \"organic\" milk, which has a shelf life of two months! That's way longer than the  two weeks * I'd been getting with regular milk. \n Technology \n Plex \n \n As part of February 28th, I cancelled all my streaming services. \n Even CrunchyRoll. \n But, nothing was lost as I was still able to watch plenty of new media using  Plex ! Plex is a media streaming service. So basically I download the movie or TV show ahead of time and the Plex server I have running as a Docker instance on my computer serves it up to the web for me to stream from the TVs in my home. \n Yeah, it's as good as it sounds. \n Proton \n \n One of the big tech companies I actually  like  is Google. Google has been with me through my ups and downs of my life. They've been a rock during the manic episodes of my life. \n But they are a monopoly. And I realized how dependent I was to Google and the power they have over my life, actually. \n So I tried to decouple myself from Google services, if only to not have such a dependency on American based companies (something Bluesky has taught me to do). That is how I discovered Proton. \n Proton  is a Swiss based company and as such, are beholden to Swiss privacy laws. They own a suite of software services that can help replace Google services. To start out, I set up a new Proton Mail account, using my  spacepirates.net  domain. You can now reach me at  christofer@spacepirates.net . Of course, I forwarded all my mail, for now. I'm slowly replacing my old email with my new one on accounts I have, but it'll be a long process migrating over. \n I encourage you to check out their other services they offer, like  Calendar  and  Drive . I think I plan to migrate over to their password manager at some point as well. \n Obsidian \n \n Funny enough, one of the Google apps I used the most was Google Keep. I used it as my note taking app but more importantly I kept my grocery shopping list there. As I was starting to go grocery shopping more often now, I needed to find a solution to this quickly. \n Enter  Obsidian . \n This note taking app is great. The  thing  for this app is you take your notes in markdown format and then you can sync your vault (folder) across the web. Then, you can also display a graph showing all the interconnectedness of your notes, assuming you properly tag and link your other articles. \n That's a nice feature, but this app fits perfectly for my needs because I already keep my notes in markdown format on my desktop. So I subscribed to  Obsidian Sync  to sync my notes to the phone app. The neat thing about this is since you're just dealing with markdown files, you don't need to pay to sync your notes; you can set up your own method for synchronizing these files. For example, I just set up my  Rasberry Pi  again and I could set up a service to sync the files. \n But I just bought Obsidian Sync because it was easier. (And it supports the devs!) \n GrapheneOS \n \n Finally. The final boss of Anti-Consumerism: De-Googling your Android phone. \n Luckily, there is a wonderful  Android Open Source Project  which provides a familiar base for open android projects to begin with. \n One of these open android projects is  GrapheneOS . \n I was really hyped to try this out. And I did! Installation was a breeze and I suddenly had a bunch of extra security features. \n I found this video which explained how to set up your account with multiple users. Ideally, you leave the Owner (default user) as the \"root\" user for installing apps, and then you have your secondary user you install the apps to. It's very secure and sandboxed, even if you don't jump through all the hoops he does to install apps outside of the Play store. \n \n   \n \n It worked great, honestly. The one thing that I had troubles with were MMS messages. I think it had something to do with setting up Google Fi on my phone, but my secondary profile was not able to send or receive MMS messages. Time after time of searching for a solution to this, I was reminded that SMS/MMS messages are insecure and you should use a more secure alternative like the  Signal  app (which I use). \n Ultimately, I failed to convince my friends to download Signal for our group chat and I needed to text my landlord a picture, so I switched back to stock Android. I couldn't figure out my issue, much as I tried. \n But otherwise, I would highly recommend GraphenOS as an alternative. \n Conclusion \n If you've read this far, thank you. I really do put a lot of effort into my posts. This one was mostly about my experiences with being a responsible consumer, but I hope it offers some insight into those looking to make similar changes in their own lifestyle. \n I have to say, by the end of the month, my grocery bill went from $325 to $536, but my dining out went from $1157 to $453 (shout out to  YNAB ). I ate out a lot February, but I also cooked a lot more in March. I was inspired by my lifestyle changes to eat out less. This is just one data point, so I'll be sure to keep an eye on these numbers over the next few months. \n I also feel much happier, more satisfied, and more fulfilled in my daily life. I don't want to attribute all of this to the changes I've been making, but I'm sure it helps I've eliminated one potential source of cognitive dissonance. \n \n \n"},{title:"SpacePirates.net Domain Acquisition",frontmatter:{title:"SpacePirates.net Domain Acquisition",date:"2021-01-28T00:00:00.000Z",description:"I finally aqcuired the domain name for Space Pirates!",author:"Christofer Padilla",type:"post",tags:["Space Pirates"],meta:[{name:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/spacepirates.net.png"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"SpacePirates.net Domain Acquisition"},{name:"twitter:description",content:"I finally aqcuired the domain name for Space Pirates!"},{name:"twitter:card",content:"summary_large_image"},{name:"twitter:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/spacepirates.net.png"},{name:"twitter:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/28/SpacePirates.net-Domain-Acquisition.html"},{name:"twitter:site",content:"@rockzombie2"},{property:"og:type",content:"article"},{property:"og:title",content:"SpacePirates.net Domain Acquisition"},{property:"og:description",content:"I finally aqcuired the domain name for Space Pirates!"},{property:"og:image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/spacepirates.net.png"},{property:"og:url",content:"https://christofer.rocks/blog/2021/1/28/SpacePirates.net-Domain-Acquisition.html"},{property:"og:site_name",content:"Christofer"},{property:"article:published_time",content:"2021-01-28T00:00:00.000Z"},{property:"article:tag",content:"Space Pirates"},{itemprop:"name",content:"SpacePirates.net Domain Acquisition"},{itemprop:"description",content:"I finally aqcuired the domain name for Space Pirates!"},{itemprop:"image",content:"https://christofer.rocks/images/spacepirates.net.png"}]},regularPath:"/blog/2021/1/28/SpacePirates.net-Domain-Acquisition.html",relativePath:"blog/2021/1/28/SpacePirates.net-Domain-Acquisition.md",key:"v-25bd5b7e",path:"/blog/2021/1/28/SpacePirates.net-Domain-Acquisition.html",lastUpdated:"6/1/2021, 8:55:34 PM",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1622595334e3,content:" {{ $page.title }} \n \n I've finally acquired the domain name for Space Pirates! \n SpacePirates.net \n I've been working towards this goal for a very long time.

It is something that I've pondered many times in my life, since as early as I was introduced to horror in literature with Poe, until being introduced to it properly with H.P. Lovecraft. \n \n Here it is, my Cthulhu inspired tattoo, among other things  #spooky   #haloween   pic.twitter.com/Jzy1i4kEGQ — Christofer (@rockzombie2)  October 18, 2016   \n \n I was never directly introduced to Lovecraft's work so much as I was exposed to the plethora of work that was influenced by him. The sheer amount of references and derivatives of the Lovecraftian entity known as  Cthulhu  is staggering. \n Lovecraftian . Even his name describes an entire genre. What was so potent about his ideas that made such waves across many mediums of storytelling? \n Fear \n I think what attracted me to find the source of these waves was fear. Not fear, as in my motivation, but rather the idea of fear. \n What is fear? And what makes things scary? \n I've always been somewhat of a philosopher (or possibly just a chronic overthinker) throughout my life and I prided myself on not having any fears. Of course, I've been scared of things before, such as  spiders  at one point. But I've learned that fear-- true, rational fear, usually stems from a lack of understanding, or more acurately, all fears are a fear of the  unknown . \n We fear what is lurking in the night because we cannot see it, and so it is uknown, as are it's intentions. The intentions of a killer  are  known, as we stare down the pointed end of a knife, and we are afraid, for we know not what lies beyond the veil of death. \n On the fear of death:  If you are afraid of death, or suffer from existential angst, a book I would highly recommend is  The Power of Now . I did, indeed, find it spiritually enlightening, especially because it describes our woes in life (of which I include fear) as direct consequences of our egoic mind fearing it will \"die\" if the ideas it associates iself with are compromised. \n The premise of cosmic horror is based on this fact, that we fear what we don't understand. What I most enjoyed about Lovecraftian horror, specifically, is that this fear was so powerful it turned minds mad. Here is a real fear we can't escape. \n There are a lot of things we know, so we can presume a rational person might not be afraid of any of these things directly. However, we must admit we don't know everything about the way our own mind operates. But, we can rest assured that for the most part it's pretty stable. \n What then if something is actively compromising this assumption? In the case of Cthulhu, what cosmic vision is enough to turn a sane mind mad? \n And so this implication, that this literally unfathomable revelation must only by comprehensible to a superior mind than ours. Indeed, even a diety's. And who can presume to know the mind of a god? \n Now then, the dread begins to sink in. Dread, being the fear of an inevitable fate, that of our ultimate demise in the face of a power far beyond our own, whose intentions cannot be known, and whose mercy we can only hope for despite all indications that it has none. \n This is the premise of Annihilation. \n Annihilation \n I've been  streaming  a lot lately. One of my favorite sounds that I use is actually from the soundtrack of this movie. It's so iconic. \n \n I decided to listen to the full song and I found that it was actually quite beautiful, to me at least. I'm not normally one to listen through movie soundtracks because I feel that taking it out of it's context is disrespecting the intent of the composite art form that is film. But I can admit this song, at least, is good. \n I started doing some reminiscing about the movie. I remembered wanting to see it when it came out in theaters in 2018, not getting the chance to do so, but still enjoying it after watching it for the first time at home. It has been a while now, so I started reading some reviews to see how well it held up. \n Naturally, I wanted to see what  reddit  thought of it. \n \n Same, bro. \n \n I was glad to hear this. I had had the book in my shopping cart for a long time and after reading this comment I decided to pull the trigger and buy the book. \n Doing a bit more research, I was also surprised to find out the director was  Alex Garland , who also directed  Ex Machina  and wrote  28 Days Later , both of which I also really loved. \n \n Of course, the bear scene. Still haunts me to this day. \n \n This was a pretty interesting take and is actually what prompted me to buy the movie and watch it again. \n If you've read this far, I would encourage you to do so as well. \n \n \n
