<div class="info"><b>Note:</b> This article was imported from my old blog, <a href="https://christoferpadilla.tumblr.com/post/81191145007/new-website">christoferpadilla.tumblr.com</a>.</div>

So it’s been a full month since I started working at my new job as a Software Test Automation Engineer at GolfNow.com. I have to say I’m pretty happy with how far I’ve come. I’m really enjoying the work I do and the people I work with.

In other news, I finally purchased the domain name for my website! Yeah! It’s currently just pointed to my tumblr blog, but once I have the rest of my website built, I’ll probably host it on Windows Azure and have it pointing to that. I’ll move this blog over to blog.christoferpadilla.com. In the meantime however, I at least have something up on my site, even if I haven’t touched this blog in ages.

I’m going to get my haircut today at Alchemy since it’s grown long enough I think we’ll have more to work with now. I’ll be updating my blog with more pictures and updates, so look for updates!
