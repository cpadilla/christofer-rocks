Man, it's been almost a year and a half. Whew. We'll just because it was the last thing I posted, I'm gonna go over my resolutions I had originally set out to do.

*   <strike>Get an internship this summer</strike>
*   <strike>Get my own place (not a dorm)</strike>
*   <strike>Read at least ten books</strike>
*   <strike>Have a playable game ready&nbsp;</strike>
*   <strike>Take the Foundation exam</strike>
*   Make my own website [In progress]
*   <strike>Get all Aâ€™s</strike>

Cool. So in retrospect I didn't do that bad. I managed to accomplish my goals that I had set out to do, even if it was not within a year.

I guess I should make a new set of goals, especially since January just happened and all.

**Goals for 2014**

*   Get a full time dev job or go back to school full time.
*   Move closer to my destination (geographically).
*   Wake up earlier (6:00 am).
*   Exercise more often or go to the gym.
*   Cut my expenses by a third.

There we go. Five goals. I should be able to get 5 goals in a year. They're not even that hard. I'll add more as I complete them. This way however, I'll be focused on a few manageable goals to have to worry about.
