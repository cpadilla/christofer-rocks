Well, it's been a while! I guess there are some things to cross off on my list now:

*   <strike>Get an internship this summer</strike>
*   <strike>Get my own place (not a dorm)</strike>
*   Read at least ten books
*   <strike>Have a playable game ready</strike>
*   Take the Foundation exam
*   Make my own website
*   Get all Aâ€™s

So I finally moved into an apartment, that was great. And as for the game, well the zombie game is playable now, so I'm crossing that off the list. We even started another project, an [asteroids clone](http://code.google.com/p/asteroidz/) as an android app, but we kinda got bored with that.

The next big thing we're planning on working on is a game using the Unity engine. Right now we're working on the story for it. This will be our first big game that we publish (and really finish) so we really want to put in a lot of effort. For now I guess all you need to know is that it's essentially a maze game. Get psyched.
