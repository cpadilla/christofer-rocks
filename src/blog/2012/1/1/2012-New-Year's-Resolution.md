It's finally 2012 and a lot has happened over the past year. I finished high school and moved on to UCF, that was probably the biggest thing for me. I got my Eagle Scout, went on a week long canoe trip and wasted away my summer. I got a new computer, a guitar, and some nice headphones, all from Black Friday (which was a first for me too). And that about sums up all that I can remember from 2011.

So this year I've decided to write down my resolutions for 2012 so I can make sure I accomplish them. Hopefully when I look back on this next year (assuming we're not all dead by then) I'll have completed all of my goals.

*   Get an internship this summer
*   Get my own place (not a dorm)
*   Read at least ten books
*   Have a playable game ready
*   Take the Foundation exam
*   Make my own website
*   Get all A's
