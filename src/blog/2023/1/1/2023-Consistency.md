Many of my goals remain the same as [last year](/blog/2022/1/1/2022-No-Excuses.md). However, I'm shifting the focus of them to center around consistency. I still want to hit my physical goals this year, but my focus will be on hitting the gym 4 times a week rather than the more long term goal of breaking my PRs.

I was inspired by a TikTok I came across which highlighted the importance of choosing your suffering; Life is hard no matter what you choose to do, so it's best if you choose how you suffer. I'm tired of being fat, of not being happy with who I see in the mirror and I miss skateboarding and doing yoga and I want to be fit enough when I retire to still be able to surf. In order to change these things, *I* need to change.

## Goals

I've set up my goals this year to be in an easy-to-manage format of weekly goals. Here are my goals for the following categories:

### Physical Fitness Goals
* #### Workout at the gym 4 days a week
> I've been using an app for a workout program I discovered on Reddit called [nsuns](https://www.reddit.com/r/nsuns). The subreddit seems to be dead actually and the app I have on my phone doesn't seem to exist on the Play store anymore, so I might have to look for a new app, but the one I've been using has been functional enough for me. I've stuck with the program consistently, so that's all that matters.
* #### Skateboard twice a week (during summer/warm weather)
> I miss skateboarding. I used to be the president of the UCF Skateboarding Club. I'm unhappy if I can't skate. I have no more excuses anymore, there is plenty of flat ground right outside my apartment and a skatepark I can walk to. I'm gonna start skating as soon as the weather permits, which honestly is now, I just need to get over the slight chill.
* #### Track every meal's calories in MyFitnessPal
> There was a trend I noticed when I first lost a bunch of weight in college. That was, I was exercising regularly, eating cleanly and tracking the calories that I ate. This seems like a simple one to stay consistent with.
* #### Cut out sugar (one cheat item per week)
> Part of eating cleanly includes removing sugar from my diet. I got into the bad habit of drinking energy drinks (for some reason) this past year. Sugary drinks seem to be the main form of sugar I intake, so this should be easy to cut. Removing sugar from my diet will leave only fat for my body to burn as fuel.
* #### OMAD Diet
> I've found success in the past with losing weight in intermittent fasting. The [One-Meal-A-Day diet](https://www.reddit.com/r/OmadDiet/) basically is intermittent fasting daily. This might be hard for me, but losing weight is hard either way, so I'm just going to have to deal with it.
* #### Go sailing again in the summer
> Last year I took a sailing class which was part of my lifelong dream of becoming a pirate and sailing the seas. It was amazing and I want to keep my sailing skills up by regularly visiting the harbor on my weekends to catch sail with a crew.

### Mental Health Goals
* #### Walk outside everyday
> Should be pretty easy to hit. I have to walk to the bus to go to work some days anyway. The rest of the days there is a park nearby I can walk to.
* #### Do Yoga 4 times a week
> When I lost a lot of weight, I was doing yoga regularly. I want yoga to become a regular part of my routine again, so I decided I'm going to keep it in line with my fitness goal of going to the gym; I'll do yoga before I go to the gym each time.
* #### Write in my journal at least once a week
> It's easy to neglect writing in my journal, especially if I'm writing blog posts consistently, but I want to ensure I still take the time to write with pen on paper, as it's not only therapeutic for me, but meditative.

### Productivity Goals
* #### Stream 4 days a week
> I've been streaming pretty regularly lately, so instead of coming up with goals surround my [game](/tags/#Space-Pirates) and [game engine](/blog/2022/12/29/The-Bones-Engine.md), I figure if I stay consistent with streaming (when I'm always productive), I will make great progress with my game.
* #### Study Japanese
> My friends and I are planning a trip to Japan in March this year, so I'd like to brush up on my Japanese vocabulary which I had learned from my flash cards when I took Japanese in college. I hope to have a beginner's level of proficiency by March.

My goals are simple this year, so I hope that I'll be able to stick to them and hold myself accountable on a weekly basis.
