Many of my goals remain the same as [last year](/blog/2022/1/1/2022-No-Excuses.md). However, I'm shifting the focus of them to center around consistency. I still want to hit my physical goals this year, but my focus will be on hitting the gym 4 times a week rather than the more long term goal of breaking my PRs.

I was inspired by a TikTok I came across which highlighted the importance of choosing your suffering; Life is hard no matter what you choose to do so it's best if you choose how you suffer. I'm tired of being fat, of not being happy with who I see in the mirror and I miss skateboarding and doing yoga and I want to be fit enough when I retire to still be able to surf. In order to change these things, *I* need to change.

## Goals

I've set up my goals this year to be in a easy-to-manage format of weekly goals. Here are my goals for the following categories:

### Physical Fitness Goals
* Workout at the gym 4 days a week
* Skateboard twice a week (during summer/warm weather)
* Track every meal's calories in MyFitnessPal
* Cut out sugar (one cheat item per week)
* [OMAD Diet](https://www.reddit.com/r/OmadDiet/)
### Mental Health Goals
* Walk outside everyday
* Do Yoga 4 times a week
* Write in my journal at least once a week
### Productivity Goals
* Stream 4 days a week

My goals are simple this year, so I hope that I'll be able to stick to them and hold myself accountable on a weekly basis.
