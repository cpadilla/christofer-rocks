I'll be honest: 2022 was a shitty year for me. I don't want to dwell on it, so I will summarize it briefly; I had another manic episode in February, which cost me [my job](/blog/2021/10/1/Life-Update-Seattle.md), one of the best that I've had so far.

I went unemployed for six months after that, living off of my severance pay and looking for work. During this time, I thought I had all this free time that I could just start streaming again and be productive, but the reality was I was just depressed from losing a good job— maybe even my dream job. I stopped working out and gained weight again.

When I finally found a new job, it quickly turned out poorly for me; I was underperforming and chaffing under the management there.

## Turning Over a New Leaf

2022 has been rough but there have been some diamonds forged in it.

I started [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/rockzombie2) again consistently after realizing I could run my preferred dev environment (FreeBSD) in a VirtualBox on Windows. This had the benefit of fitting in a nice 16:9 window on my super ultra wide monitor (32:9), which made it easier to stream from. I also no longer needed to choose between being productive or casually gaming upon boot-up as I did when I was dual-booting. I could seemlessly transition between the two operating systems with this new setup.

Because I started streaming again, I decided to use [my TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@rockzombie2) account to promote my streams. I found a [video editor](https://www.capcut.com/) that was as intiutive to use as you would expect a video editor to be. It's allowed me to quickly edit short TikToks from my video content.

I've always thought I would make a good director because I think I have a natural "vision" of how things should look. Editing seemed like a natural extension of this talent and my recent videos I've been making seem justification of that idea.

I also created my first YouTube video for my [rockzombie2](https://www.youtube.com/rockzombie2) channel, which was a tutorial for setting up my dev environment.

The year is coming to a close soon, but I just wanted to provide a recap of what's been going on with me before my typical [New Year's Resolution Post](/tags/#New-Year-s-Resolution).

Happy Holidays!
