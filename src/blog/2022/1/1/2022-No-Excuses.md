This year I'm going to keep things simple. I only have one resolution that I want to hold myself accountable for.

I used the think that I would be in the prime years of my life by around 30 years of age. Now, as I approach that age, I find that I've let myself go and am running out of time to accomplish it. I've had excuses in the past, but now that I'm financially stable, I really have no excuse to not get into the best shape of my life.

So that is my goal for this year. Everything else is secondary to that. To be specific and to have measurable goals, I want to beat my personal record for the following lifts:

* Bench Press: 205 lbs.
* Overhead Press: 165 lbs.
* Back Squat: 270 lbs.
* Deadlift: 285 lbs.

I set a goal last year to lose a measurable amount of weight, which I failed, so I won't do that again. Instead, I want to get into [calisthenics](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+calisthenics) as a workout. I think as long as I can support my own body weight, I'll know I'm not overweight. I still have to look into how specifically I want to incorporate calisthenics into my workouts, but I think push-ups and pull-ups will suffice for now.

Excercise is only half the battle, though. My other goals revolve around nutrition, and they are:

* Track calories consumed daily
* Cut out alchohol from my diet
* Restrict meat consumption
* Hit macro goals daily

Most of this will be done via MyFitnessPal.

That's pretty much it. I want to have fitness as my singular goal now in order to devote as much energy as I can to it.

Cheers.
