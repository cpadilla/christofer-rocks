My first encounter with Communist Daughter, although I have a feeling it won't be my last. A song Dougie recommended to me. I thought it was pretty good at first, but it wasn't until I took another look at the lyrics that I appreciated it a lot more. I don't know that I'll be able to stop listening to this song now. It reminds me of how I think I should feel about my youth.

<div class="info"><b>1/21/2021 Update:</b> Indeed, I loved the entire album and particularly enjoyed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4lmv6dldJUd7YLniafabiw?si=KvJmahAZT-iUnpFrNGGrjw">Soundtrack to the End</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6ujPPVZaz2od9sOWT7MkLF?si=6hDVN28dRfyqujJ1x_4EBw">Tumbleweed</a>.</div>
