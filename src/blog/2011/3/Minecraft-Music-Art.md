Minecraft is a wonderful game. It was my friend who really introduced me to the artist behind it's ambient music, C418. While some of the songs are weird and outright disturbing, I've found that the ones that are calm and soothing are great to listen to while programming, reading, or doing whatever. [Here's](https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha) where C418 has so graciously gathered the best of his work in one convenient location for you to enjoy. Not to mention how stunning that graphic is. Really, I love that image.
