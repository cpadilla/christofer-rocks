A nice little song thats perfect for being depressed or getting you depressed, as the case may be. I stumbled on this while playing a flash game called One Chance. It was a deep, provocative scene where your wife commits suicide. I find myself attracted to this song when I'm feeling passive and lethargic. I can attest to the effectiveness of this song as a sleep inducer.
