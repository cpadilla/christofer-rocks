<div class="info"><b>Note:</b> This article was imported from my old blog, <a href="http://nakedlogic.blogspot.com/2011/03/ebb-and-flow-to-multiply.html">nakedlogic.blogspot.com</a>. The original article had the soundcloud link to the song embedded, but since it's behind a paywall now, the embedded code doesn't work anymore. I've replaced the Soundcloud link with a Spotify one instead.</div>

[Simple Math](https://soundcloud.com/manchesterorchestra/simple-math) by [Manchester Orchestra](https://soundcloud.com/manchesterorchestra). I have to admit, I first found out about Manchester Orchestra because a girl I knew liked Bad Books, their singer's side project. But I like them.
