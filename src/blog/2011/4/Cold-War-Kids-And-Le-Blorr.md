Just saw Le Blorr open tonight for Cold War Kids. It was an awesome show. We got an encore from Cold War Kids and I got a shirt and a free CD from Le Blorr. I am so happy right now. This was definitely the best birthday present I've ever gotten.

<div class="info"><p><b>1/21/2021 Update:</b> It's incredible the impact this show had on my life. Le Blorr being a relatively local band, I saw them many more times after that. To this day, I still have a signed copy of their CD and a signed copy of the album poster I got for supporting their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/868466773/save-le-blorr">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>Le Blorr became SWIMM and I met Chris and Adam again many years later, which is where I got my CD signed.</p>
