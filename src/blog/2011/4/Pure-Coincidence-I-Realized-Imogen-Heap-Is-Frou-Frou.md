<div class="warning"><b>Notice:</b> The Soundcloud link I embedded used Shockwave, which is no longer supported on browsers. Since this must have been well over a decade ago, I wasn't able to find the specific cover of such a popular song on Soundcloud, unfortunately. I've linked the original song via Spotify instead. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3xKTpGCsafXzV4muM1Hpl3?si=WcStc-h0QKe6Lz3-IvtGJw">Frou Frou</a> is good too.</div>

Yeah. Pure Coincidence. I've known about Frou Frou for quite a few years now. It wasn't until I randomly found this awesome guitar cover of Hide and Seek on Tumblr that I stumbled on the song. And I'd heard the song before, too. In the end, though, I'm glad I found this.
