I had my Court of Honor on Saturday. It was pretty good. I'm glad I finally finished it. I worked hard for it and now it's my crowning achievement. I gave the Mentor pin to my twin sister, Christina because I felt she deserved it. She has always been there for me, and I never really appreciated her for it until then. I'm glad she's my sister and for her influence on me, making me the person I am today.
