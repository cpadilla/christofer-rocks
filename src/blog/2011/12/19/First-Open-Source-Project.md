Oh, man I’m excited for this! After my awesome externship at IDS, where I first encountered the beautiful phrase “Version Control”, I was able to upload my code to Google Code and set up a repository for my project. Now, Kevin and I can work on the code together! This is exciting and I’m sure this project will move forward now (finally).
