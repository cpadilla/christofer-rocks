# {{ $page.title }}

2024 was a good year. I'll try my best to summarize it for you.

In January, I saw Travis Scott live, It was epic; he brought out Kanye West as a special guest. The reveal was super hype.

In February, my friends and I went to MegaCon, a local nerdy convention. I dressed up as a Jedi with my lightsaber.

The Star Wars Unlimited trading card game came out, and I played that for a while. It was really fun and I even got lucky and pulled a super rare showcase variant of the most popular leader, Boba Fett. I got it graded: 9.5. It went down in price recently after Fantasy Flight Games [suspended](https://starwarsunlimited.com/articles/a-leader-suspended) the card.

I redid my entire linux setup, adding a few more drives and choosing ZFS as my file system, using RAIDZ2 redundancy. This basically was meant to be my end game OS, allowing me to have a safe place to store digital files for years to come.

Crazy enough, I had been living in Florida this whole time without a car. It was unfortunately stuck in Seattle while the engine was being replaced by my insurance. I basically went a full year without my car. Finally, in May, it was delivered to me and I got to have a car again!

I celebrated my one year anniversary working at Oddball. It's been a great company to work at and I've been very happy working here.

I started looking for a place of my own to move into during the summer and found a cozy little duplex right off of Mills avenue near downtown Orlando. I really liked the location and pulled the trigger on it, moving into it July 13th.

In September I saw a band I really liked called Eli & Fur. It was around this time that I started playing Poker again at some home games. I also played a lot of Commander again.

My sister came and visited me in October. We had a blast hanging out and we also went to Halloween Horror Nights, which was pretty fun.

I won a costume contest with my Halloween costume!

Christmas was great this year; my sister and her girlfriend flew in to Orlando and stayed at an AirBnB. We did a Christmas crawl between all of our houses, which resulted in a very fun Christmas time! I also got to spoil my niece and nephew which was fun.

Overall, I would say I'm very happy this with where I'm at in life at this point in time.

## 2025 New Year's Resolution

I have a lot of goals for 2025.

### <ins>Use Duolingo</ins>
* My [resolution](/blog/2024/1/3/2023-Reflections.html#reflections-for-the-new-year) last year was to practice my Japanese more regularly. That failed pretty miserably.
* I've proven I can't stick to a learning regiment on my own so I'm hoping Duolingo will be the structure I need to stick with learning another language.
### <ins>Stick with YNAB</ins>
* This one's pretty simple. Budget every Sunday and stick to it.
### <ins>Stream at least 2 days a week</ins>
* Stream on Twitch on Mondays and Saturdays regularly.
### <ins>Write an article a month</ins>
* The whole point of having a blog is to write more.
### <ins>Write 6 rough draft chapters of my book</ins>
* My goal is to write a book one day. This is a concrete step towards that goal.
### <ins>Get my hand tattoo</ins>
* I've been wanting to get a hand tattoo from [this guy](https://www.instagram.com/eddiexbird) for a while now.
* He's in Los Angeles, California, so my plan is to book a trip there. It'd be a good excuse to visit.
