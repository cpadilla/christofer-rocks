When I was around 17, I was in Boy Scouts and nearing the deadline to reach the rank of Eagle Scout. It was something that I really wanted to achieve. Each rank has certain time requirements associated with it so I worked backwards and calculated how much time it would take to meet these requirements before I turned 18.

It turned out, I was very close to a month away from being too late to achieve my Eagle Scout rank. With the full perspective of my path towards my goal, I was motivated to take action and complete my objective.

I had an epiphany recently: I'm a very goal oriented person. I thrive when I have an objective and a clear path towards success. It should be apparent by that fact that I've been making 
[New Year's resolutions](/tags/#New-Years-Resolution) for about a decade now.

2024 was me getting back on my feet, but I feel like I'm thriving now.

## Learning Japanese

I've been sticking to my [New Year's resolution](/blog/2025/1/1/2025-New-Years-Resolutions.md#use-duolingo) to use Duolingo daily. However, I started thinking about my motivation behind learning the language; It's because eventually,

<b>I want to move to Japan.</b>

With this in mind, I began planning my path to achieving my dream.

It turns out, there is a shortage of digital workers in Japan. [Japan is projected to fall short of 2.3 million digital workers in 2026.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/editorials/2024/02/09/japan-digital-transformation/) This creates opportunities for foreign workers like myself to be able to gain entry into the country via a work visa. I already found some [job postings](https://www.tokyodev.com/) that I could potentially apply to.

Based on this video I watched, it sounded like I would have an advantage over the competition if I had two things: Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) level N2 or a master's degree.

As it so happens, I'm already on my way to getting a master's degree. That leaves passing the JLPT. It turns out, Duolingo is not so great at helping you pass the JLPT. While I'll continue to use it to supllement my learning, I decided I needed a proper course set on helping me pass the first level, JLPT N5.

Luckily enough, there was a [course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/japanese-n5-course/) I found on sale that I picked up. I also found a handy [Flashcard maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alpaca.flashcardsmaker&hl=en_US&pli=1) app that I bought to create flashcards on my phone for the vocab.

With this guided structure for learning, I decided it's time to revisit my goal for this year. In addition to using Duolingo daily, I want to also practice my vocab and learn from my JLPT course each day in order to pass the JLPT N5 test by the end of the year.

## Timeline

I would like to move to Japan while I'm still in my 30s. Working backwards, I'm almost 32 now, so that would give me 8 years at maximum to make this happen.

If I were to take one class a semester, I estimate that I'd complete my master's degree in six years. While this puts me within range of my goal, I would like to see if I can finish my master's degree in half the time by taking two classes a semester. I should like to try this for my first semester to see if this is sustainable.

The reality of the situation is that if I were to take a job in Japan, I'd most likely be making a fraction of what I am currently making in the US. Therefore, it might be more prudent to take my time in preparing to move so that I can maximize the money I save before moving.

At this point in my career, I've worked in big tech and I've realized money isn't as important as a good work life balance but it's still an important balance that should be made.

Thankfully, I have set another goal this year to budget weekly, which should help me save money towards moving to Japan in the future.

## Reflection

In the end, I realize that I haven't been making the most of my time because I haven't had a real goal that I've been working towards. After I lost my job in Seattle, I basically just was living from day to day.

I think I have the capacity to focus my time and energy into achieving my goals, so long as I have worthwhile goals. So this year, I want to be more focused, going about my day intentionally. I set up my whiteboard in my house, finally, so I can start writing my daily and weekly goals on it and see it every day.

Now that I've written down my intentions, it will surely come to pass.
