# My Love of Comics

![Blame - Chapter 26](/images/blame.jpeg)

When I was in boy scouts, I developed a fond memory when my friends in my troop and I were hiking on a long, hot (and boring) trail somewhere in Florida. I remember we started talking about some of the more interesting stories in Marvel comics. I don't even remember what stories, by I do remember being enamored with the the [lore](https://twitter.com/rockzombie2/status/1244872401105666048) behind them.

At the time, my favorite super hero was spider man. Perhaps because of the close similarities to the super-ness of spiders in nature. I've always been interested in a spider's ability to produce [silk](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Cindy_Moon_(Earth-616)#Powers_and_Abilities) and spin webs. I remember fondly my brother and I would draw our own spider man comics.

Recently, I found the same spark that kindled my love of comics as when I was on that hike in a video I found on TikTok describing some of the new developments in the DC universe.

Thus, I went down a rabbit hole, exploring the DC universe. Up until this point, the only comic I had been keeping up with was [Dragon Ball Super](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/dragon-ball-super), which had just finished a dissapointing arc, but still offered a promising future. There was also a [Death Note One-Shot Special](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/viewer/1006371), which was amazing but short-lived.

Anyway, I decided to go visit a local comic store to check out the next issue of Death Metal, which was the series that continued the Darkest Knight story line. I haven't really explored Wilmington since I've moved here in August, mostly due to the pandemic.

While I was there, I picked up a copy of one of my all-time favorite comic: WATCHMEN. It is a masterpiece. I started watching the HBO series recently, which I think is decent so far.

But the original WATCHMEN comic is a graphic novel I wanted to have in my collection, just like I have certain comic-inspired records in my collection, such as MF DOOM's *MM..FOOD*, Czarface's *Every Hero Needs a Villain*, and Wu-Tang Clan's [*Protect Ya Neck*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_Ya_Neck).

Upon reading the forward, I discovered that it had been [inspired](/blog/2020/12/29/A_Remarkable_Coincidence_of_Inspiration.md) by Bob Dylan and his song Desolation Row.

Interesting.
