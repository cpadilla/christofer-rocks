# Chronicle (2012)

![Chronicle (2012)](/images/chronicle.jpg)

Chronicle is a movie about three guys in highschool as they develop telekinetic powers. It came out in 2012, which was right after I graduated high school. Since the movie follows the story of high school seniors, I found it especially relatable at that point in my life.

The story of developing super powers and being catapulted from an otherwise mundane and average life is a relatable fantasy that I'm sure many teenager's like myself indulged in. In many ways, I saw the same struggles I experienced in the life of the main character; themes like isolation, alienation and unhealthy coping habits are all explored in Chronicle.
