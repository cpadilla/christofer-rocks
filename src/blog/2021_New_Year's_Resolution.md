# 2021 New Year's Resolution

2020 was a rough year for me.

I was hospitalized after a psychotic episode back in March. I spent my birthday in a psych ward. After that I lost my job which I had just started at the beginning of the year.

This was right as the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread and quarantining became the new way of life. My mental health took a serious nosedive during this time. I was unemployed for 6 months looking for a job during a pandemic. I had to sell all of my bitcoin just to get by, which was a shame in retrospect since that was around the time it was the lowest price this year.

In an unfortunate series of events, I spent my life savings (nearly $20k) on a new mustang. This was right after I got out of the hospital in Daytona. I wasn't prescribed any new medication so I have no idea why they let me go. Still being in my delusional state of mind, I spent the money I had taken out to purchase bitcoin on a car to get home instead.

As if that wasn't bad enough, I foolishly "rented out" my car to make a quick buck while I tried to sell it for good. Then the person who I rented it out to wrecked it and ghosted me. Worst case scenario achieved.

Finally, things started to turn around when I found a new job in North Carolina. I decided it would be best to move up there from Florida and get a fresh start.

Things have been going pretty good since then and I finally feel now as if I'm back on track to accomplishing my goals. One of those goals was to finish my blog. And so I have!

2020 wasn't all bad. The start of the year I had an amazing time camping with friends and celebrating my brother Carlos' birthday at the Okeechobee music festival.

It blows my mind that the last time I made New Years Resolutions was back in 2017. At least according to my last blog post.

Here are my goals for 2021.

* Accumulate 1 full bitcoin.
* Develop a working prototype of my [Space Pirates](/tags.md#Space%20Pirates) game.
* Lose 30lbs.
* Take up kiteboaring.

I think those are the 3 goals I want to focus on. It incorporates budgeting my fincances, dieting, and dedicating myself to a productive hobby of mine as well as learning a new one.

I'm very optimistic about this next year.
