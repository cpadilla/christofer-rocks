Woo! What a year.

2016 was a lot of things, but overall I think it was a pretty good year. It’s all perspective anyway.

I try to make a list of New Year Resolutions each year, but I haven’t really thought about it until now, so before I do let’s go over the goals I set last time (damn that was 2014):

*   <strike>Get a full time dev job or go back to school full time.</strike>
*   <strike>Move closer to my destination (geographically).</strike>
*   <strike>Wake up earlier (6:00 am).</strike>
*   <strike>Exercise more often or go to the gym.</strike>
*   Cut my expenses by a third.

Nice. Still don’t really wake up that early but I would say I’m more of a morning person now. I just like to sleep in a lot.

Here’s a list of things I wanna do for 2017!

*   Start/Make/Finish my website
*   Get all A’s
*   Read at least ten books
*   Land a Tre flip
*   50-50 grind
*   Nose manual
*   Kickflip a gap/down a stair
*   Travel somewhere out of state
*   Start a band
*   Make some form of passive/side income

That sounds good for now. I’m pretty excited for this year honestly! I realized that for all the ups and especially all the downs of 2016, I think it’ll be easy to make 2017 an even better year.

Happy New Year!
