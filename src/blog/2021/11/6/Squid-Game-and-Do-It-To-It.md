[EDC](https://electricdaisycarnival.com/) is an interesting music festival to me. I think there are a lot of good EDM artists that end up headlining at it, and while I enjoy listening to them and think a lot of them would be good live, I doubt you would ever find me attending such a festival.

These festivals whose lineup is almost exclusively [EDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music) tend to attract a specific crowd, or so I've noticed. See, when I was going to college in Orlando, festival season would roll around and I would see and hear different people talking excitedly about their outfits they'd picked out for EDC. I have a suspicion that most of those types of people were the type to also join fraternities and sororities. I didn't know any of them close enough to confirm this-- I generally tended to avoid them. Probably because the best way I could find to describe them was [extra](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=extra). Or maybe I'm just pretentious.

Regardless, even though EDM festivals are places I avoid, it doesn't mean I don't appreciate a lot of the music coming out of it.

<div class="info"><b>Fun Fact!</b> At one point in my life I actually used to live very close to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7KxmXPK9D5FEQk5fA">Tinker Field</a>, where EDC Orlando is held, on the infamous <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=obt">OBT</a>. Not a very fun point in my life and perhaps part of the reason I was never impressed with the festival to begin with.</div>

## Release

EDC Las Vegas happened in October, where Zedd dropped a mashup between 23's _Pink Soldiers_ from Netflix's wildly popular show _Squid Game_ and Acraze's lead single _Do It To It_.

## Discovery

I discovered this song right around the time it dropped on Tik Tok, of course. I have to say, I was pretty impressed with the song; it was very catchy and complemented the already iconic song from _Squid Game_.

Browsing through the comments, I found a few that were similar to this one:

> @vanursa:Me in bed rn ü¶óü¶üü¶óü¶óü¶üü¶ó

That cracked me up. It was pretty fucking funny!

For some reason the image of a bunch of girls at home in bed, all watching this TikTok "popping" their backs in the same fashion these little bug emoji's implied amused me to no end.

A few days later, I came back to this TikTok, honestly to find the cricket comment which had kept me amused the past few days. I also wanted to find the song but it was funny to me that this was almost a secondary reason.

I found it easily enough on YouTube, where I could hear the full studio quality of it. I was very impressed with it. The production on it was very clean. Especially on the intro; if you recognize the original track from the show, you'll notice the slight stutters Zedd introduces to the vocalizations that really elevate it to a proper EDM intro.

That's it. It's a catchy song. ü¶óü¶üü¶óü¶ü
