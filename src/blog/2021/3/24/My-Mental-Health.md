Today is my birthday. I [try not to notice](/blog/2011/3/I-am-18-years-old-today..md) them, but this one is significant to me because it marks 1 year since my 27th birthday, which I spent descending into madness inside a behavioral hospital. 10 years since I became an adult. My life turned out pretty much how I had hoped it would, except for the periods of my life marked by [acute paranoid psychosis](https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/q-and-a/whats-the-difference-between-psychosis-and-schizophrenia).

That wasn't part of my plan.

My mental health has been a topic I've been hesitant to bring up for a long time now, mostly out of fear of the stigma associated with mental health disorders.

My family is no stranger to mental illnesses. Their effects have had deep repurcussions on my life growing up. But that's something I won't really go into. For this article, I'll be focusing on *my* mental health and the impact it has had on my life as an adult.

To preface, I think the first recognizance of my mentla health came as a child when I was diagnosed with mild ADHD. I never really noticed the effects Adderall had on behavior or thoughts so I never took this diagnosis very seriously and was ultimately taken off the medication. I think the diagnosis was mostly related to the fact that I admitted to often having difficulty sleeping, a problem which would persist into my adult life with little impact on my responsibilities.

By the time I graduated high school, I was independant, self-sufficient and most importantly, happy. My mental health was not on my radar at all. I knew I was relatively smart and capable and I prided myself on my ability to think critically and plan for the future. My confidence came from my recent [ACT](/pdf/ACT-scores.pdf) and [SAT](/pdf/SAT-scores.pdf) scores as well as the fact that I had achieved my goal of earning the rank of [Eagle Scout](/blog/2011/5/Eagle-Scout.md) before my 18th birthday.

Life was good.
