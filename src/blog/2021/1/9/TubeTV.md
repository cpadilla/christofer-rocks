# TubeTV

I recently found myself in posession of an old tube TV. You know what kind I'm talking about.

I couldn't figure out what model it was, since if there was a sticker on the back revealing that information, it had long since peeled off and/or faded away into obscurity. It's a Mitsubishi similar to the one shown above.

I found it lying in front of someone's yard. Coincidentally, I was actually on my way to pick up an entertainment center. I've been picking up a lot of used furniture to furnish my apartment lately. I also recently acquired a [rug](./The_Eternal_War_Machine.md).

I copped that for $20 bucks! What a bargain!

The TV was free, not only as it was just sitting there, but because it had a black garbage bag duck-tapped over it and a piece of paper taped to the front of it that declared *FREE TV! IT WORKS!*

I was feelin' mighty appreciative at this point in my life so I was eternally grateful to be blessed with another TV in my house, as I figured I could use it upstairs or do something fun with it.

Besides, it had that *nostalgia* factor to it that I couldn't resist.

Funny enough, the TV now sits on the entertainment center I picked up.

## The idea of the TubeTV

I figured out right quick what that *something fun* I was going to do with it was!

As I was organizing my apartment, I pulled out of the closet an extra keyboard that I had lying around and placed it on top of the TV. It fit the vibe.

That keyboard is an [IBM Model M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard), made famous for it's unique [buckling spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling_spring) keys. Or at least the [closest](https://www.pckeyboard.com/) thing to it. There's a [long history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A-vRZth7SI) to it.

Anyway, I realized with all the blog posts I've been writing, it would be nice to be able to use this keyboard again. Why, I could even hook it up to the ol' TubeTV to complete the nostalgic vibe I had going on!

I threw away my old laptop when I moved, unfortunately, so I didn't have something I could hook up to the TV. I held onto my old laptop for so long because I loved the keyboard on it. (You'll notice a theme here.) It was also my first laptop, so it had extra sentimental value as well.

Alas, this could finally be the good excuse I needed to buy a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)!

Since most of my blog posts are created by writing [markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) locally and then commiting them with [git](https://git-scm.com/), I figured I could cobble together a simple writing workstation that would fit my needs. It might even prove to be a more distraction-free environment I could focus with!

## Assembly Instructions

A Raspberry Pi recipe:

    1x Raspberry Pi
    1x Model M keyboard
    1x RCA adapter

Okay, I know that much at least. But I'm not sure what Raspbery Pi unit specifically I should get. Let's review my requirements to find one that fits my needs:

* Wifi connection
* USB port
* Able to connect to an RCA adapter
* Able to plug into a wall outlet
* SD card memory

OK. A quick google search led me to [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=165943) article, which tells me what I'm looking for is an [A/V Composite cable](https://thepihut.com/products/av-composite-cable-3-5mm-to-3-x-rca-3m). The new Raspberry Pi models use a [4-pole Audio Jack](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/07/raspberry-pi-model-b-3-5mm-audiovideo-jack), which carries both audio and video signals. Itâ€™s similar to sockets found on other multimedia devices such as iPods, MP3 players and smartphones.

Perfect. I'll buy one. $9 bucks.

Awesome. Now I know that I can just get the newest [Raspberry Pi 4](https://makerbright.com/raspberry-pi-4-8gb.html) and rest assured it will come compatible with my RCA cable.

Add on a few bells and whistles and BOOM! $120 bucks. I'll swing that.

So for about $130, I can have a cheap PC and a new work environment. Sold.

Between my art project and fun money, it falls within my [budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) for this month, too.

That's that! I'll post an update picture when it all arrives and I have it set up.
