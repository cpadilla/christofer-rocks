# The King (2019)

It's interesting, the sequence of events that led to me watching *The King*. It more so had to do with my interest in Timoth√©e Chalamet than just browsing and stumbling on the Netflix film, so I'll first provide some backstory as to how I became mildly obsessed with him.

## Background

It was Fall of 2016 and I was a Junior attending the University of Central Florida. I was at a mini camping festival event called Tent City put on by a progressive activist club called Campus Peace Action. It was a fun time full of great poeple and it was easy to talk to and meet strangers at this event with how friendly everyone was. It was here that by chance I overheard a conversation being had between two guys; someone was explaining in great detail a fascinating story. I was intrigued by this tale of space-faring civilzations, humans with computer-like thinking abilities and a spice resource that could grant prescience to the user.

I am talking, of course, about *Dune*.

### Dune

[*Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) was the first book in a series mostly written by Frank Herbert in 1965 (with some further expansion to the series written by his son Brian Herbert after his father's death). As such an early icon in science fiction literature, it has [inspired](https://screenrant.com/ways-dune-influenced-future-sci-fi-movies/) many works of science fiction which are today consider staples of the genre. Works such as *Alien*, *Star Wars*, *Blade Runner*, and *2001: A Space Odessy*.

There's a lot of history to *Dune* that I could go over, but I'll save it for when I inevitably do a [case study](/tags/#Case-Study) on the film releasing later this year.

Suffice it to say, after reading the book I had become very interested in rumblings in Hollywood of director [Denis Villeneuve](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898288/) in talks to direct a movie adaptation. I had previously been impressed with his movie *Arrival* and *Blade Runner: 2049* and couldn't think of a director with a better track record for sci-fi movies.

I felt that Star Wars had begun to turn stale and was looking forward to the development of a new sci-fi franchise.

Fast forward to late 2020 and the trailer for the movie drops. And it is *HYPE*.

Among the star-studded cast are some actors whom I greatly admire: [Poe Dameron](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1209966/) from Star Wars, [Thanos](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000982/), the [psychotic assassin](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000849/) from No Country for Old Men, [Aquaman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597388/), and the new [MJ](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3918035/) from Spider-Man.

And yet, among these great actors is one I'm not familiar with: our boy Timmy.

### Timoth√©e Chalamet

Just from the *Dune* trailer alone it's obvious from the gativas with which Chalamet portrays the character of Paul Atreides the depth talent he posesses as an actor.

As I was swept up in the hype of the new Dune movie trailer, I started doing my own research into the movie to tide me over until it's release. I joined a [book club](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/ipjge8/dune_book_club_being_held_on_discord/), read some articles and looked into what information I could find on the production process of the movie. As I did this, I found myself watching more and more interviews of Chalamet and learning about his career. I found one interesting [interview between Timoth√©e Chalamet and Emma Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Lj1Cx4pNUw) and I was really impressed with how genuine he seemed.

At the time, I had also received the latest issue of GQ, which featured none other than our boy Timmy. I've always enjoyed reading magazine articles as they are usually a more insightful form of interview and found the cover story on him to be no different.

It turns out, Timoth√©e Chalamet had also played a role in another film I thoroughly enjoyed: *Interstellar*. He played the son at the beginning of the movie.

I still wanted to watch something he had played a leading role in, however. I decided to go out of my way to watch a movie with surprising parallels to *Dune*.

## *The King*

I've already spent a lot of time setting up pretext to the movie, so I'm only going to briefly review some of the themes I've found interesting about the movie. I'm mostly going to focus on certain scenes within the movie that touch on the following themes: The Church and it's power and influence over the crown, censorship, responsibility, and the horrors of war.

*To be continued...*
