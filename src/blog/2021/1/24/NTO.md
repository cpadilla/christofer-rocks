I came across NTO when I used to stream a lot a few years ago. I was listening to a lot of EDM music and a few of his songs that I really enjoyed: The Hound and [Alter Ego](https://open.spotify.com/track/18MlLrfCkYOnKutil99GwY?si=OHfaxhPLSLOF4URfh56fdQ), both of which you can hear in the video above. I've been watching a lot of DJ sets on my TV lately.

There's not much else to say about him. I noticed in his bio, he has a close relationship with Joachim Pastor, who had a song I also really liked.

> The story behind NTO started with a match made in heaven, a kid from the South of France always hooked to his guitar, and electronic music. After going to the Sziget Festival when he was 18, NTO started to hang out regularly at La Villa Rouge, and Bar Live, two legendary clubs in the South of France. At the time, German miinimal techno music was booming and Anthony Favier would spend his nights listening to Stephan Bodzin, James Holden, or the very beginnings of Paul Kalkbrenner.
> The story behind NTO is also about his friendship with Worakls and Joachim Paster, with whom he created Hungry Music in 2013. Performing together on the Olympia's stage to the Vieilles Charrues Festival, they learned to master the stage. Thanks to his hits "Trauma" and "La cl√© des champs", which account for several millions of streams on DSPs, NTO's career took off internationally.
