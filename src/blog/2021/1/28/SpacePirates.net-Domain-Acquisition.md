I've finally acquired the domain name for Space Pirates!

[SpacePirates.net](https://spacepirates.net)

I've been working towards this goal for a very long time. You can see the transaction being made below.

I made a simple placeholder page for the site for now. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/cityplanners/spacepirates-net). Eventually, I'll deploy the client side code to the site, but for now I'll continue development in [The Hacker Club's GitHub repo](https://github.com/the-hacker-club/space-pirates).

One step closer to making [#spacepirates](/tags/#Space-Pirates) a reality.
